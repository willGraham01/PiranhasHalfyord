# Scenes

The Piranhas of Halfyord is designed to be played out over several scenes.
Each scene is itself a short sequence of events that will involve the party in some way, and serve to move the story along if the party is dawdling on what to do next.
The scenes also allow us to break up the adventure into manageable chunks for the DM to organise, and also give the players some measure of progression.

The majority of each scene takes place in one location in the town of Halfyord.
Some scenes have the party move between locations, but usually only one of these locations will see any activity beyond social interaction, so should not require large-scale setting nor description.
Dividing the adventure up this way also allows us manage the rate at which information is made available (or discoverable) by the party, and also set some benchmarks for what the party will hopefully learn from each scene.

Each scene has a loose sequence of events that should unfold whilst the party is in them.
Some of these events might be in direct response to the party's actions, others are necessary to the plot progression, and others are optional to make the world feel a bit more involved.
Feel free to deviate from, mix up the order of, or rework these events as the adventure unfolds - no plan ever survives first contact with the party!

## Scene Interdependency

Earlier scenes can have events that influence the later scenes, and in most of these cases the party's actions will play into these effects.
These interactions are designed to give the party the impression that they are having an effect on the world, and give their hastier actions consequences.

Tracking these interdependencies does increase the DM's organisations burden however, so feel free to ignore these slight changes if you so wish.
We provide a "default" for each such interdependency which can be used if taking this approach.
The main effect of taking this approach will be the final confrontation with Carlton, whether Groubun is arrested or escapes, and whether Faire is restored to elf-form.
In the default ending; Carlton will be killed by the party after having his ultimatum / bargain rejected, Groubun will escape arrest, and Faire will be restored to elf form but without his memory as a cat.

### Groubun's Suspicion

The main mechanic to track throughout the story is Groubun's suspicion of the party.
There are several things that the party can do to arouse Groubun's suspicion throughout the course of the adventure, and if his suspicion gets too great he will flee Halfyord on the day of the reverse heist after hearing what happened.

Groubun's suspicion is tracked by a number of points that can be accrued throughout the adventure:

- FIXME

Groubun starts at 1 point.
If Groubun reaches FIXME suspicion points, the gang will have an increased presence at the docks during the day.
If he reaches the higher FIXME points, he will be in the process of fleeing Halfyord when the party comes to apprehend him (if they are aware of his involvement, of course).
If his total exceeds FIXME points, then he will have fled before the party gets a chance to arrest him.

These "points" can also be used as a consequence for the party's actions that this document does not forsee.
They can also be rewards, for example buttering Groubun up in the Ordo might improve his disposition to them, and you may reward them by removing a point from his tally.
