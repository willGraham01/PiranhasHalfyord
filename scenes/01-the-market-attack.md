# The Market Attack

The adventure begins with the party - either as a collective or individuals - present in Halfyord's great market.

This scene serves to do several things:

- If the party do not already know each other, it can provide the basis for forming a party, even if temporary.
- It gives the party some kind of vested interest in going on the adventure (being victims of the attack).
- It introduces the problems the town is facing firsthand, rather than through description.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have suitable motivation for working together to help the town of Halfyord.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- They can recover silver necklaces from any killed or captured Piranhas members. Shufharz will identify these and share some information on them.
- They can examine the remains of the spilled potions of animating the gang members use.
- They will be aware of the hit-and-run tactics that the Piranhas employ.

## If the party does not know each other

If the player characters do no know each other yet, have them explain what their character might be doing in the market square.

- Are they just passing through by chance?
- Are they shopping for a souvenir, keepsake, or particular item?
- Are they assisting the temple, or busking, etc.

The players do not need to be together for the beginning of the adventure, but all need a reason to be drawn into the action.
If possible, try to tie the start of the heist into the activity that one of the player characters is performing.
For example, a character might be haggling with a shopkeeper and have their recently-purchased item swept up in the coming heist.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Great Market Square.

It is mid-afternoon and the square is busy with the afternoon business spike, before it dies down during the evening.
There is the faint sound of dockworkers and ships, alongside gulls and other waterfowl, coming from the docks.
A number of merchants have their wares laid out on movable carts, or rugs and blankets on the ground.
A few wealthier merchants have what looks to be hired protection for themselves or their wares, and there are a few guards posted at the square's entrances.

Amongst the shoppers are members of the Piranhas gang, ready to spring their latest plan into action.

## The Piranhas Attack

A number of Piranhas gang members will be present in the crowd (see the combat below for recommended numbers), each carrying a potion of lesser invisibility and potion of animating.
They will each approach an upper-end merchant stand; such as a jeweller or silks merchant, etc.
When one of them gives the signal, they will each drop their potion of animating on the ground, shattering it and animating the merchant's goods.
If the merchant has a guard, they can also be seen to smear a powder into their faces, which will turn out to be a sleeping draught.
If confronted early, the gang members will spring the heist early on whatever is nearby, and attempt to cover their tracks.

After the party has introduced themselves and established what they're doing in the market square, have them all roll a perception check:

- (Perception 15): The character notices the three gang members enter together and then split up to separate kiosks.
- (Perception 10 - ADV: character is bartering with a merchant): The PC notices raised voices, or the presence of a gang member near their stool acting unusually.

The potions will animate the goods of the merchants who were chosen as victims.
The objective of the gang is to transport as many of these goods back to their base as possible, however first and foremost they don't want to be tracked down themselves.

If a character notices the Piranhas gang members approaching, give them an action to intervene or otherwise prepare themselves before the fight breaks out.
They may choose to accost the gang members, take up a vantage position, or tip off the guards.
But whatever they do, the gang members will spring their attack and trigger the [following combat](#combat-encounter).

## Combat Encounter

The Piranhas throwing their potions causes panic in the market square.

### Encounter Information

Trigger: The Piranhas gang members throw their potions of animating at some merchant's goods, or a player character suitable accosts one of them.
Intended difficulty: Easy / Medium

Participants based on party size:

| Party size | Gang members    | Loot wolves     | Other adjustments |
|:----------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
| <=3        | As many players | 2               |                   |
| 4          | 3               | 3               |                   |
| 5          | 3               | 5               |                   |
| >=6        | 5               | As many players |                   |

Enemy Objectives:

- Gang members will be attempting to flee rather than fight. They have invisibility potions to aid their escape, and are not looking to start killing. They won't *not* kill if the situation calls for it, however.
- Loot wolves will flee unless provoked by the players, or the gang members are severely threatened. Loot wolves animated from non-valuable goods will always attempt delaying actions.

### Initial Locations

- Piranhas gang members should be near merchant stools and/or posted guards.
- Animated loot will also spawn near merchant goods. These should be spread out across the market square, but each player should have one or two within reach of the first round of combat.

### Other Encounter Factors

- To ensure that no player is far away from the action, ensure that every player is close to at least one animated loot or gang member at the start of combat. Overwrite the usual rule on how much loot potions of animating spawn if necessary.
- After the death of one member, the other gang members will redouble their efforts to flee the scene. Allow them to do this and use the animated wolves as cover to prevent a pursuit.
- The market crowd will scatter when the animated loot appears. Assume that the crowd acts first in combat and uses their action to move away from the scene, allowing freedom of movement. The merchant victims and their hirelings will also attempt to move to minimum safe distance.
- After a couple of player characters have taken a turn in combat, the alarm bell will be raised by one of the on-duty guards. Mention that it starts to toll.
- After one round of combat, Shufharz and a garrison of nearby troops will be seen rushing down the main street from the barracks. They will arrive in three round's time, at full sprint. The gang members and animated loot will heavily shift focus to getting away when they arrive.

### Loot

- Piranhas necklace off any killed or captured gang members.
- A cheap ring or other trinket from one of the merchant victims (if all the goods were saved by killing the loot wolves). Alternatively, provide a discount at one of the stores in Halfyord as a friend-of-a-friend bonus.

### Notes

In the interest of advancing the plot, it may be prudent to allow at least one gang member to be killed or incapacitated during this fight, so the party can inspect the corpse for the Piranhas necklace.

The party also has a chance to capture a gang member here, which will impress Shufharz.
There are some guidelines on what they party can learn from [captured gang members in the appendix](../appendix/appendix-capturing-gang-members.md).

## Aftermath of the Attack

Once the dust settles, merchants will slowly return to their stools to inspect the damage.
Other civilians will stat to crowd around the area to see the commotion, and Shufharz' guards will be attempting to cordon off the area.

Shufharz should arrive before the party sustains any casualties, and the gang is not actively looking to inflict any.
If a player character is close to dying, have one of Shufharz' men be trained in first aid, or a priest from the temple be present to automatically stabilise the party member if Shufharz's retinue is still yet to arrive at the square due to a fast combat.

If Shufharz has yet to arrive, the party has the opportunity to look around the market before it is declared a crime scene.
They will still have this opportunity after Shufharz questions them, and before they leave the market square.

- (AUTO) Necklace(s) recovered from any killed or captured gang members if searching the bodies.
  - (AUTO) Showing the necklace to Shufharz will have her reveal the gang's identity.
- (Investigation 10) If a merchant's guard was knocked out by a Piranhas gang member, the residual substance can be identified.
  - (Arcana 10 / Survival 15) to identify it as a sleeping draught.
- (Survival 15) To determine the general direction of the escaping animated loot and gang members, if any were visible whilst escaping.
  - (On 20+) Gang members can be tracked to the bridge across town, and a necklace will be dropped on the route if not already recovered.
  - (Investigation 15) To notice that the sewer grate in the corner of the market has now been torn off.
- (Arcana 12 - ADV: Detect Magic, AUTO: Identify spell) To identify any residual magic on the animated goods that were saved.
  - (On 17+) This effect came from a potion, not an innate casting of magic, suggesting the user themselves does not possess any magical talent.
- (Persuasion 15 - DIS: Not all the loot was saved) To get a reward from a merchant for intervening (see possible combat loot).

Shufharz will question the party on what they saw.
Her attitude will be positive if at least one of the animated loot was stopped, any gang members were killed, and very positive if a gang member was captured.
The market will be declared a crime scene, but the party will be allowed to investigate the nearby vicinity so long as they are upfront with Shufharz.
The guard escort will begin to close the market and encourage people along though - at this point any merchants whose goods were saved will be thanking the party too.
Otherwise, they will be brash with Shufharz and may even mention that this isn't the first they've heard of these "attacks", and question why the town guard can't deal with it.

After her initial questioning, Shufharz will take stock of the situation (and may be accosted by concerned merchants).
Shufharz will express an interest in the party helping them with the gang problem if her attitude is positive or the party have mentioned a vested interest in helping her (for example, a party character had an item stolen).
Otherwise, she will be more suspicious of the party, but will still request their help since she can be fairly certain they're not in league with the Piranhas.

Regardless, she will promise a reward for helping and more information if the party comes with her to the magistrate's office, where they can speak privately.

## Next Scenes

The party should proceed to [Hired Help](./02-hired-help.md) after this scene.
