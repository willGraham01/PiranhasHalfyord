# Scouting the Docks

After visiting the Ordo Magicae, the party meets Shufharz at the docks to reconnoiter the area in preparation for tomorrow.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the party with an opportunity to plan ahead for the heist.
- Provides some threads that the party can follow up on during the day.
- Provides a hook for following Groubun, or a second chance to cast suspicion upon him.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have discovered at least one of the gang symbols, and be more aware of what to expect tomorrow.
- Caught suspicion of Groubun and followed him to the Day's Rest.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- There is a gang stash under the bridge which gives away the number of gang members who will be in disguise.
- A gang member has added themselves to the roster for the shipment tomorrow.
- The warehouse directly across from the mooring station is largely empty, only presently containing a small workstation and some tarpaulin-covered crates.
- The crane can be operated manually.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Docks

The party will arrive here after visiting the Ordo Magicae to pickup items from Jenessa.
At this point it will be early evening, street lights will be starting to come on and the town guards on patrol will be carrying torches.
Notable places where there is a lack of vision include underneath the bridge (where the docking platform extends under the arch of the bridge), and inside the warehouse near the mooring station.
Otherwise, low light levels will not impede investigation.

Shufharz will already be at the docks and will be talking to the Harbourmaster and Ship Captain.

## Regrouping with Shufharz

Shufharz has selected a particular docking station, near the bridge over the Hal, as the location for the ship to moor tomorrow.
Shufharz will provide the party with a briefing about the arranged events and important locations at the docks:

- The boat will moor at this docking station, and the cargo will be unloaded whilst the Ship's Captain talks to the Harbourmaster.
- The cargo has been listed as a collection of precious gems and alchemical ingredients that is en route to the Ordo, but in reality contains mundane items like furniture, vegetables, and salted meats.
- Shufharz herself will be patrolling at the far end of the docking station. (In reality, this ensures that she will be too far away from the action to help during the day so the players have more agency).
- Notable lookout points include the bridge itself, the docking crane, and near the mooring station. You can have the Harbourmaster and Ship's Captain interject about how goods are usually unloaded into a nearby warehouse too, to draw attention to the warehouse.

The party can talk to the Harbourmaster and Ship's Captain if they choose to get a better idea for "standard procedure" on a normal working day.
If they decide on their roles, then they can also forewarn these characters before the events of tomorrow.
The Harbourmaster and Ship Captain are on a need-to-know basis with the plan, so don't have the whole picture.
They will provide any information they are capable of, though.

Shufharz will ask the party to decide on the roles they want to perform during the day tomorrow.
If a character wants to be on the ship itself, this can be arranged provided they wake up earlier than the rest of the group and ride downriver for 2 hours to get on the boat before it arrives.
Shufharz will also remind them of the insignia of the Piranhas, and the usual docking procedures.
She'll also reiterate that the gang needs to be lead to believe the contents really are valuable before they'll attempt to strike.
The objective is to follow the gang back to either their hideout or the location that they are "sending" the loot.

Finally, Shufharz will also give the party a set of [networked earrings of message](../items/networked-earrings-of-message.md) with enough earrings for the whole party plus Shufharz.
This will allow the party to communicate should they decide to split up now, later in the evening, or for tomorrow.
Shufharz will request these back from the party once the adventure is complete.

## Investigating the Area

After the initial conversation with Shufharz, the party can scope out the area for clues, traps, and other things.
Reward ingenuity with appropriate checks, and likewise allow the party characters to take on any roles that they might want during the heist (such as posing as the harbourmaster or ship captain, etc).
The notable locations of interest are listed below, along with anything that can be found there.

If any characters go up to the bridge to inspect it, resolve that area last.
Otherwise, once the party seems to have completed their investigations, have [Groubun's pass-by event](#groubuns-passby) trigger.
Allow the party to investigate at least 3 of the locations before having Groubun go passed; at least one of which should be the [Bridge Underpass](#investigations-the-bridge-underpass).

### Gang Signs

There are a number of gang signs left by the Piranhas around the area.
These can be discovered by a character investigating the relevant area by passing any of the following checks:

- Investigation DC 15
- Perception DC 15
- Grant advantage on these checks if a character has any of:
  - Thieves' Cant
  - Criminal or other background feature that might involve leaving coded or cryptic messages.
  - The party has previously found one of the gang's other marks, and the character is aware of this

Once a sign has been discovered, a character can attempt to "decode" it, or ascertain its meaning:

- (History DC 15) (ADV: Thieves' Cant language) (ADV: Criminal or other background feature that might involve leaving coded or cryptic messages) The meaning behind the sign can be inferred.

Each event that has a gang mark will describe what that particular one looks like, and the information that is obtained if it is deciphered.

## Investigations: The Mooring Station

The mooring station consists of a straight platform like one might see on a canal, with hitching posts that boats can attach to.
Wooden pallets can then be used to bridge a walkway between the moored ship and the dockyard itself.
The mooring station has an unloading area where the cargo is normally moved to, on a level slightly above the mooring station itself.
The station is a good 50-100 feet or so from the crane and the bridge, though the former's arm is able to be moved to raise cargo from the deck of a docked ship.

The Harbourmaster and Ship Captain can brief the players at this location so can provide any ideas based on the player's investigations:

- Dockworkers ferry the cargo on and off the ship as they arrive, so a character could pose as one of these un-loaders. Players can use this to "pretend" the cargo is something that it isn't; EG by deliberately making out that what they're carrying is heavy, or glowing, or has a particular smell, etc.
- The Harbourmaster usually discusses the logistics of the unloading with the Ship's captain on the raised level above the loading area. This is also where dock workers assigned to unload the ship will gather whilst the ship is mooring.

The information that can be garnered from this location is as follows:

- (Investigation DC 10) (Perception DC 10) (Asking the Harbourmaster about this topic) This area is accessible by the public, so the party might conclude this is a location from which the gang might attempt to throw their potions.
- [GANG SIGN](#gang-signs). Whilst looking around the area, a character notices markings etched into the low wall on the upper level near where the cargo is unloaded. It has the same mark as the gang's necklace design that the party has encountered, along with some other arrows sketched around it.
  - The mark has a tooth which appears to have it's point lowered onto the floor. Along the floor, various arrows are drawn pointing towards where the end of the tooth makes contact with the floor. FIXME: picture?
  - (Deciphered) The mark can be deciphered to indicating something like a meeting spot or staging post.

## Investigations: The Docking Crane

The docking crane is adjacent to the bridge, but on a much lower level.
It sits above the cargo loading level, and is winch operated with two cranks.
The Harbourmaster does not operate it directly but can give a brief summary of how it is operated.
They will mention that only more senior dock hands are trusted to oversee it though.

There is also a billboard opposite the crane controls, on which one of the relevant notices is the worker assignments for tomorrow.

- (AUTO) A quick inspection of how the crane operates will give a character the idea that they can feign the weight of unloaded goods by deliberately operating the crane slowly.
- (Perception DC 10) The crane can be operated in such a way that the cargo can be lifted from the loading area over the river, rather than onto the main road where a cart would presumably be waiting. The party can use this to ensure they know where the gang members will be aiming to use their magic, and present an "easy" target.
  - (Survival DC 10) (Suitable toolset DC 10) The crane looks like it can be rapidly swung in a large (30ft) arc along any level of loading area. This would undoubtedly force anything _in_ those regions to rapidly vacate the area of suffer some painful consequences.
- (Investigation DC 7) A manifest and loading order is present beside the crane, on a large billboard. It details the unloading schedule for tomorrow and the goods to be unloaded.
  - 10+: There is also a worker's schedule on the billboard for tomorrow. It looks like there has been a recent shift-change as one named is crossed out for another.
  - 15+: Rifling through some of the older schedules that have been left on the billboard from past weeks, the new name does not appear on any of those assignments.
  - The Harbourmaster delegates the day-to-day worker assignments to some of his senior dock-hands, so will not be able to offer any incriminating information about the new name that is present. The docks are one of the largest employers in Halfyord, so it is possible that the worker in question has recently joined or just been moved from another mooring station to cover for someone else.
- [GANG SIGN](#gang-signs). There is a gang mark next the billboard.
  - The mark has a tooth that appears to be part of a necklace (like the necklaces the Piranhas members wear). The necklace is drawn in such a way that it looks like it is being tucked into a shirt or pocket. FIXME: image
  - (Deciphered) The mark can be deciphered as indicating that information for a cover story, or some kind of safehouse or hiding spot is nearby.
  - If the mark is deciphered and the party have also seen the new name on the board, a character can infer that this is likely the cover story that the mark refers to.

## Investigations: The Warehouse

The storage warehouse near the mooring station will be locked - the Harbourmaster has a key in his office but won't be particularly keen to hike to it and then hike back.

- (Persuasion DC 13) To convince the Harbourmaster to walk back to the office and pick up the master key. This takes him about 30 minutes, and [Groubun's Pass-by](#groubuns-passby) might happen in the meantime.
- The Harbourmaster will know (without having to go to the office) that this warehouse should be empty due to the expected shipment coming in tomorrow.
- The Ship's Captain knows that Shufharz has procured this warehouse for the "goods" he is shipping to be unloaded into.

The warehouse itself is two stories high, with large (padlocked) double-doors at the front facing out onto the docks.
There is a window on the upper floor directly above the large doors, whose shutters are closed.

- (Perception DC 10) A character can notice that these shutters are not closed tight, so could be opened from the outside to provide more immediate access.

Characters can attempt to access the warehouse via the window, or just wait for the Harbourmaster to walk to his office and back.
If they choose the breaking and entering route, going via the window will require appropriate checks (at the DM's discretion) to get access, though the shutters are not locked.

- (Thieves' Tools DC 20) To pick the padlock on the large doors.

Inside the warehouse is a massive supply of empty boxes and crates, covered with tarpaulins, which have been pushed to the back and sides of the warehouse floor.
There is a small workstation in the back right corner of the ground floor that looks to house various repair and woodworking tools for use during loading.
A staircase runs up the wall next to the workstation to get to the upper floor, which much like the lower floor contains a few empty crates and tarpaulins (though of a smaller size).

There is nothing of interest in here currently, but if a character later investigates the lead on the missing working during the day, allow them to roll an investigation check to determine if anything in the warehouse has been disturbed.

## Investigations: The Bridge Underpass

The bridge underpass is dark and narrow.
The arch of the bridge reduces the width of the walkway by about half, though there is a banister on the river facing side.
Only a single torch sconce is present in the walkway, placed fairly high up the arch, but it is lit.
Looking through the underpass, a character can see the civilian docks start on the other side of the underpass.

It is dark under the bridge - without a light source or darkvision, checks to investigate the area are at disadvantage.

Once the area has been illuminated by a suitable source, mention that there are the shapes of fish in the water, the ripples from their movement seemingly caught by the light.
There also looks to be a fishing rod left leaning against the arch of the bridge, partially resting against some vines that have grown up the archway.

- (History DC 12) (Investigation DC 15) (Perception DC 15) The arch of the bridge is well-kept and crafted from stone. Most of the mossy plant life that you would expect to see has been cleaned off - likely to keep up appearances for the town.
  - (Survival Dc 10) (Nature DC 10) (ADV: The absence of mossy plant life has been noted) The plant life that remains is not typically found near canals or rivers - it looks like a garden climber plant that one might see decorating a house or mansion. Furthermore, a portion of it looks to be spread across an area of the wall in a very precise lattice-shape, rather than a natural formation.
- [GANG SIGN](#gang-signs) The plant life conceals a gang mark.
  - This mark looks to have several shark-like teeth (like is found on the Piranha gang's necklaces) being either placed into, or removed from, a box.
  - (Deciphered) The mark can be deciphered as indicating that a cache or supplies is located nearby.

The "lattice-shaped" portion of the plant is meant to resemble a net, and conceals the hidden cache that the gang mark is referring to.
It cannot be cut by non-magical items, but the "fish" swimming in the vicinity of the underpass walkway are actually constructs, similar to the loot wolves encountered earlier.
If a player wishes to look in the water for clues, make sure to mention the fish.
A character can also notice that:

- (Survival DC 12) (Nature DC 12) (Animal Handling DC 10) One fish-shape is swimming alone in a regular pattern.
  - 15+ / 13+ Animal Handling: The same shape is not attempting to stay out of the well-lit areas (if the torch or other light source is in use).

Fishing out the "fake" fish from the water will reveal that it's a piranha, with a single silver tooth in the mouth rather than rows of teeth.
When this comes into contact with the "net" like portion of the plant on the wall, the plant will recoil away from the teeth.
This will reveal small hole in the brickwork behind the vines, revealing an approx 2-by-2-by-2ft cubic alcove containing the following supplies, intended for the gang members tomorrow:

- Potions of invisibility (20 minutes, one for every 2 gang members that will be present).
- Sets of plain clothes, similar to what travellers might wear.
- Sets of dockworkers clothes.

The exact quantities of these items will depend on how many gang members are going to be present tomorrow, which depends on your party size.
See [the relevant combat](FIXME) for the numbers.

The party should be able to infer that this means _some_ gang members will be present tomorrow in disguises; as a members of the public or travellers, and others as dock workers.
If the party wants, they can remove any items from the cache and the gang will not have them at their disposal tomorrow.

## Investigations: Top of the Bridge

Heading up a stone set of stairs will take a character from the dock level to the bridge, or alternatively the road can be followed past the loading crane in a gentle slope and in a U-turn to arrive back at the bridge without needing to use these spiral stairs.
The bridge is well lit with gas-powered street lamps - from the bridge one can see along the entire length of the docks.
The bridge itself is approximately 5 stories (30ft) higher than the loading area, and has decorative bannisters and railings along its edges.
The main road across town runs through the middle, with a wide pavement for pedestrians either side.
The bridge wil be busy with members of the public crossing both ways to get to their various evening destinations - party members will never be alone atop the bridge.

- (Perception DC 15) From this vantage point, a character notices that there is a sewer grate with a missing cover on the same side of the docks as the mooring station. The grate empties out into the river, and there are several more along the docks at each mooring station that have a cover.
- [GANG SIGN](#gang-signs) There is a gang sign etched into the bridge railing on the side that faces out over the mooring station.
  - This gang sign has a tooth that has been made to look like the nose to two very narrow eyes. FIXME: image
  - (Deciphered) The mark probably indicates a vantage or reconnaissance point.

A character can look off the "opposite" side of the bridge to the loading area, which looks out onto the civilian transport docks - a number of small ferries and fishing boats will be visible on this side.

If any characters go up to the bridge to inspect it, resolve this event last, since [Groubun's Passby](#groubuns-passby) will trigger afterwards.

### Groubun's Passby

After the party have had a chance to complete their investigations, the party members up on the bridge might notice the figure of Groubun going across the bridge.

- (Perception, DC 12 PASSIVE) The party notices Groubun crossing the bridge.
  - 14+: Groubun is carrying a satchel bag with him, slung over his shoulder. Despite this, he is still clutching it with one hand, indicating that what's inside might be either heavy or valuable.
  - (Insight, DC 12) Groubun is walking at a faster pace than most other members of the public. Still at walking speed, but there is a purpose to his step.
- (Stealth, DC 10) (DIS: The character is not aware of Groubun's presence) Any members on the bridge avoid drawing the attention of Groubun.
  - If half (rounded up) of the party members fail this stealth check, Groubun gains one point of suspicion.

As Groubun walks across the bridge, someone will bump into him, causing a small clattering of bottles onto the pavement.

- (Perception, DC 10 PASSIVE) A character not on the bridge, or on the bridge and not aware of Groubun's presence, hears the clattering of bottles.
- (Perception, DC 12 PASSIVE) (DIS: Character is not on the bridge) An apologetic exchange is heard between a member of the public and a voice that is recognised as Groubun's.

The party should hopefully recall that Groubun's reason for excusing himself was to do research in his study and then make a trip to the temple, and have their suspicions raised.
Be sure to mention the sound of bottles hitting the floor to further draw their suspicions, particularly if they previously investigated his potion brewing in the lab earlier.

Shufharz will suggest following Groubun if the party discusses these events with her, or via the networked earrings of message.
Though she is still sceptical of Groubun's involvement, she will say it's better to be safe than sorry.

If the party decides to trail Groubun, they will be lead to the Day's Rest.
Using the earrings, they might delegate a trail party and have the other members catch up.
Have the group that pursues Groubun roll a group check:

- (Stealth, DC 12) The pursuing group does not draw the attention of Groubun.
- If failed: Groubun will notice the group pursuing him but not react - gains one point of suspicion, unless he already gained one from noticing the party members on the bridge itself.

## Next Scenes

If the party decides to follow Groubun, they should proceed to [The Day's Rest Tavern](./05-the-days-rest-tavern.md).

In the event that the party do not follow Groubun, jump right to the [preparing for the heist event](./06-planted-cargo.md) of that scene - the party will presumably go back to the barracks with Shufharz in this case.
