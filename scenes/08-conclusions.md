# Conclusions

This scene summarises the possible endings of the adventure, and how the party can interact with the characters for closure.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Resolves Groubun's fate, and lets the party discover this.
- Provides the party with their reward.
- Resolves any hanging plot threads.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have completed the adventure!

## Setting

This scene takes place in several locations.
Formally, it will begin when the party leaves the hideout and emerges back to the Day's Rest Tavern ground floor.

## Emerging from the Hideout

What happens when the party emerges from the hideout, back into the cellar and then the tavern itself, depends on whether the party took Carlton's deal.

The party at this point will need to make contact with the guard and Shufharz, either to hand over Carlton & Fordem, report their death, or lie about the hideout being empty.

### Rejecting the Deal

During the time the party has spent in the hideout, Shufharz will have put the town guard on high alert and the town itself into a semi-lockdown state.
There are increased patrols at street level, and Hope will have attracted the attention of one such patrol as it was passing the tavern.

- Hope should always be able to do this in some capacity; even if the party actively takes steps to prevent her from doing so, such as locking her in one of the tavern rooms or even rendering her unconscious (which can happen if the party sneaks into the tavern and assumes Hope to be hostile).
  - If the party actively sent her to get extra help, then Shufharz' arrival can be expatiated, and she can be present when the party emerges from the cellar.
  - If she is locked in a room, Hope can have shouted out one of her windows for help, to get attention.
  - If she is unconscious (or worse), have one guard patrol pass by with a trained dog whose attention was drawn to the tavern.

The guards who are in the tavern will notice the party emerging from the cellar, which provides a convenient hook for the party to report to them, and them to direct them to wherever Shufharz is (or one of the guards to go and fetch Shufharz, bringing her to the tavern).
This also presents an opportunity for the party to report on their suspicion (if any) of Groubun, and the true nature of Whiskers.
If the Confining Collar has been removed from Whiskers, he will follow the party around town, waiting for their visit to the Ordo outpost.
Effects such as Speak with Animals will also now be applicable to Whiskers, so they can learn directly from him that he's Faire.

### Taking the Deal

If the party [exchanged information for Carlton's freedom](./07-infiltrating-the-hideout.md#carltons-hq) earlier, then there will be no guard presence at street level when the party re-emerges.
If Hope is around, the party will have to lie that they did not find Fordem down in the cellar either (he will be gone with Carlton when the guard eventually turn up and investigate themselves).

Once the party exits the tavern, it will not take long for them to encounter a guard patrol, who they can report to.
From here, the scene follows a similar path to the case when the deal had been rejected, with the obvious difference that Carlton & Fordem are not being handed over to the town guard.

The other point of contention is Whiskers, who will have overheard the "deal" being made in the HQ.
However, he will value his return to elven form over being the good citizen and reporting the party's deal, his egotistical nature potentially even justifying it as the party making the "morally correct" choice.
As such, he will not spill the beans on the deal with Carlton, and will be slightly more pleasant towards the party once he is cured.

## Apprehending Groubun

After reporting to Shufharz (or a guard patrol, if the party feels under time pressure), the party may decide to head to the Ordo outpost to arrest Groubun and search for the cure for Whiskers (if they know of it).
Shufharz will accompany the party if the party was debriefing her, though she will need to be shown some evidence of Groubun's involvement before she approves of the idea.
Whiskers will also come with the party to the Ordo.

When the party (and possible accompanying allies) arrive at the Ordo outpost, Groubun may have already fled Halfyord.
The situation the party arrives to depends on his current suspicion level, as [detailed in the corresponding section](../scenes.md#groubuns-suspicion).

- If Groubun has 2 or fewer suspicion points, proceed to Caught Red-Handed.
- If Groubun has 3 suspicion points, proceed to Fleeing the Scene.
- If Groubun has 4 suspicion points, proceed to On the Run.

**NOTE:** If the party has no clue about Groubun's involvement, this scene still plays out normally if [On the Run](#on-the-run) would be triggered.
Otherwise, the other two events do not happen, and Groubun simply takes up the role of Ordinator after the grace period following Faire's disappearance expires.

### Caught Red-Handed

When the party arrives at the Ordo outpost, everything will appear normal.
Jenessa will be working the store front as usual, and when the party turns up (potentially with a retinue of guards) will initially be friendly, but ask why they are here.
If asked whether Groubun is here, she will direct them to the lab on the second floor.
She will ask for the reason for this visit, and the party can give as much information as they wish.
If Shufharz is present and has been convinced of Groubun's involvement, she will directly tell Jenessa of his involvement and that they are here to arrest him.

Groubun will be working on some experiments in the lab, blissfully unaware of the situation that transpired at the docks earlier in the day.
He will be quite surprised to see the party (and potentially members of the town guard) appear in his lab, and will not have time to react to their entry.
If presented with enough evidence of his involvement, such as the Confining Collar or Whiskers, he will know the jig is up.
He will confess his motivations in front of the party, and surrender to them quietly.
He will not offer to cure Whiskers be default however.

### Fleeing the Scene

When the party arrives at the Ordo outpost, everything will appear normal.
Jenessa will be working the store front, but as the party enters Groubun will be crossing the store front from the stairs, carrying a large backpack that looks rather full.

- (Perception DC 12) Groubun is also carrying a sizeable coin purse, the kind that might form an emergency or "rainy day" fund.

Jenessa will ask Groubun where he is going nonchalantly, but Groubun will notice the party and panic, and try to escape using his magical abilities.
Roll initiative in this situation to determine if Groubun is able to flee - he will not be trying to harm the party nor Jenessa unless it is necessary for his escape.
Jenessa will panic and take shelter in a suitable part of the store front for the duration of the conflict.
If Groubun drops to 0 hit points in the fight, have him drop to unconsciousness.
Jenessa an recover her wits at this point and stabilise Groubun to prevent his death, and the party can remove his items to prevent escape when he wakes up.

If Groubun is apprehended, the event the proceeds in similar vein to [Caught Red-Handed](#caught-red-handed); when he regains conciousness, Groubun will confess his involvement and motivations, but will not offer the cure for Whiskers.

### On the Run

When the party arrives at the Ordo outpost, the store door will have the "closed" sign on it and the light will be off.
The lights on the upper floors will be on, and peering inside via the store windows will not indicate that anything is out of place or missing.
Looking at the upper floors will reveal something however:

- (Perception DC 15) To notice smoke coming out of the lab windows. These windows are open and the smell is starting to spill onto the street.
- (Survival DC 15) The smell of smoke is coming out of the lab windows on the upper floors. It smells like paper or wood is being burnt.

The party can ring the bell to the store, or force their way in - do not require a check for this.
Shufharz carries a master key and so can also provide access if she is present.
If the party elects to wait, after a few minutes a rather distressed and soot-covered Jenessa will answer the door, and ask for their help containing the fire in the lab on the upper floor.

Once inside, the party will find Jenessa and one of the other Ordo members attempting to control a large fire in the lab on the upper floor.
They can either assist or simply wait for them to get the fire under control, there is nothing left to salvage in the fire.
Jenessa will explain that she and the other Ordo member noticed the smoke shortly after Groubun left a couple of hours ago - he mentioned to Jenessa that he had some potions brewing in the lab but said these shouldn't be volatile.
In actual fact, Groubun set off some substances that eventually caused the fire.

Going through the ashes and what remains will lead the party to notice that Groubun and Faire's logbooks are no longer present in the lab, and the fire looks to have destroyed or warped most of the lab apparatus, as well as the research notes on Groubun and Faire's desks.
Characters can also pick out some of Groubun's personal correspondence from the ashes, though it will be too damaged to learn anything from.
The letter from his family, if found in the earlier visit, will be recognisable from the partially-burnt letter seal.

Groubun will escape capture in this scenario, and have gone on the run.
He will have left Halfyord and be beyond the jurisdiction of Shufharz and Kamonas.
Jenessa will explain that she will compile a report to the Ordo Magicae council.

## Curing Faire

After handling the Groubun situation, the final question mark the party faces is what to do about Whiskers.
If Groubun is was apprehended, the party can attempt to persuade him to manufacture the antidote under careful watch.

- (Persuasion DC 20) (ADV: Incentive offered, such as a commuted sentence) To convince Groubun to manufacture an antidote (without the memory loss effect) to administer to Whiskers.

If Groubun cannot be convinced to make the antidote, the party can inform Jenessa of Whiskers' true nature and offer up any additional information they have, on top of Groubun's confession.
Jenessa will say that she will include this in her report, and she can use Speak with Animals to talk with Whiskers provided the collar has been removed.
However, she will comment that she does not have the ability to manufacture a cure herself, so for the time being Faire is stuck as a cat until the Ordo Magicae can send help.

If the party does not even know of Whisker's true nature, Groubun will not tell of this either.
Again, the party can ask him about what he did with Faire, and he will lie and say that he left his fate to the Piranhas' gang.

- (Animal Handling DC 13) To notice that Whiskers gets agitated and begins hissing when Groubun talks about Faire's fate.
- (Insight DC 17) To determine that Groubun is lying about Faire's fate from his body language.
  - (Persuasion DC 14) (AUTO: Evidence that Faire is alive) To call Groubun out on this lie, and have him reveal that Whiskers is Faire.

If not told otherwise, Faire will have to come to terms with his new life as a cat.
Jenessa will be very distressed at the news that Faire is "dead" and Groubun is culpable, since it leaves the Ordo guildhall without any members of significant rank and means it will likely be closed to save the Ordo Magicae's reputation whilst they conduct an investigation.
Jenessa and the other staff members will likely be re-assigned to other guildhalls, or loose their permanent positions if no suitable roles in the guild are available elsewhere.

## Rewards

After resolving all other plot threads, the party stands to get their reward.
Shufharz will ask the party to take up temporary lodgings in the Day's Rest Tavern whilst the city scribes and guards complete their investigation and sweep of the hideout.
She will also ask if there is anyone suitable to look after the tavern "part" of the Day's Rest whilst the investigation is underway - the party can choose to mention Hope here, otherwise Shufharz will mention that the city legislators will look into the matter of ownership.
At this point, Shufharz will request the [Networked Earrings of Message](../items/networked-earrings-of-message.md) back from the party, and Jenessa will ask for the [Ring of Seeking](../items/ring-of-seeking.md).

The party can take up residence in the Day's Rest for the next couple of days, effectively having downtime for this time.
They may choose to help with the hideout investigation, use the services the town provides, or interact with some of the characters already introduced.
Hope will still be living in her room in the tavern, and will have been roped into coordinating access and setting up temporary facilities for the investigation with the guard (by Shufharz if she was told about Hope by the party earlier).
Regardless, and after a day a city legislator will arrive a day later asking for her, informing her that the Day's Rest is now technically under her ownership, since she is listed as having a permanent residence at the address on the bill of sale when Fordem purchased the tavern.

Unless Hope has a severely negative disposition towards the party, she will be elated at the news that she now owns a business of her own, even if she is apprehensive due to her lack of experience.
She will regard the party very highly, and offer them "mates rates" for the duration of their stay at Halfyord.
This will be free food & board for the few days the party needs to stay at the tavern waiting for their reward, and afterwards a discounted rate when they stay at the tavern.

After a few days, the guard and city officials will finish their investigation.
Shufharz and Kamonas will summon the party to the magistrates office, where they will be invited to the council hearing explaining the events of the last few days, end of the Piranhas' activates, and possibly trials for some combination of Carlton, Fordem, and Groubun.
Faire will be present for these hearings if he is known to be alive - if he is a still a cat he will be sat on a high pedestal with a cushion, and minded by Jenessa.
He will attract a lot of attention and humour from the other city elite in this state.
Otherwise, no-one from the Ordo will be present, since Groubun (now Ordinator) knows he cannot allow Carlton or Fordem the opportunity to implicate him in the trial.

After the hearing, the party will meet Shufharz and Kamonas in Kamonas' office.
If the Ordo still has some leadership remaining, the Ordinator will also join for this conversation.
If Faire is still a cat, Jenessa will also be present as his translator.

Kamonas will thank the party for their help, and the group will provide the party with their reward:

- If the party did not loot the vault, and caught Carlton and Fordem, Kamonas and Shufharz will be delighted at the outcome and comment that all the missing valuables have now been recovered by their legal owners. A sizeable collection from the victims has been obtained as a reward for the party's actions.
  - The party receives (party size) * (1d4 platinum pieces + 1d10 gold pieces + 1d10 silver pieces) in total, as payment.
  - Businesses and other merchants in Halfyord have a slightly better disposition towards the party for the next couple of months, which may play into haggling interactions.
- If the party looted some of the vault contents, but didn't let Carlton and Fordem go, Kamonas will comment that not all of the missing valuables and items could be recovered. She will put this down to the gang moving some of the funds out of Halfyord in the weeks prior, but it does mean that the town treasury, as well as reward donations from the wealthier victims, were a bit more lacking. Shufharz however will be very happy that the gang leaders were caught.
  - The party receives (party size) * (2d6+1 gold pieces + 1d10 silver pieces) in total, as payment.
- If the party did not loot the vault, but let Carlton and Fordem go, Shufharz will not be pleased with the fact that they could not be found, but Kamonas will remind her that the primary objective was to stop the gang's activities. Kamonas will however note that not all of the valuables were able to be recovered, again putting this down (correctly) to the escaped leaders taking what they could carry with them.
  - The party receives (party size) * (2d6+1 gold pieces + 1d10 silver pieces) in total, as payment.
- If the party looted some of the vault contents, and let Carlton and Fordem go, Shufharz and Kamonas will be glad the ordeal is over, but disappointed at the cost. Kamonas will mention that it will take a long time for the town to recover from this, and Shufharz will note that it is likely that the Piranhas will simply relocate to another city and restart their criminal activities there. Regardless however, the party has upheld their end of the bargain.
  - The party receives (party size) * (1d4 gold pieces + 2d10 silver pieces) in total, as payment.

If the Ordo ordinator is present, they will also reward the party for resolving the matter of the missing Ordinator:

- The Ordinator will reward the party with a Ring of Spell Storing (2nd level).
- Magically gifted members of the party who are not already members of the Ordo will be offered the rank of affiliate. Non-magically gifted members will be offered the position of associate.
  - This is essentially a rank that indicates the Ordo Magicae guild recommends the party for their talents, similar to a positive tradesman review in the modern world.
  - This rank does not offer full membership into the guild, but would be considered a first step to obtaining as such.

## The End

The party obtaining their reward marks the conclusion of the adventure.
