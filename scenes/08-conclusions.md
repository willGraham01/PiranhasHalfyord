# Conclusions

This scene summarises the possible endings of the adventure, and how the party can interact with the characters for closure.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Resolves Groubun's fate, and lets the party discover this.
- Provides the party with their reward.
- Resolves any hanging plot threads.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have completed the adventure!

## Setting

This scene takes place in several locations.
Formally, it will begin when the party leaves the hideout and emerges back to the Day's Rest Tavern ground floor.

## Emerging from the Hideout

What happens when the party emerges from the hideout, back into the cellar and then the tavern itself, depends on whether the party took Carlton's deal.

### Rejecting the Deal

During the time the party has spent in the hideout, Shufharz will have put the town guard on high alert and the town itself into a semi-lockdown state.
There are increased patrols at street level, and Hope will have attracted the attention of one such patrol as it was passing the tavern.

- Hope should always be able to do this in some capacity; even if the party actively takes steps to prevent her from doing so, such as locking her in one of the tavern rooms or even rendering her unconscious (which can happen if the party sneaks into the tavern and assumes Hope to be hostile).
  - If the party actively sent her to get extra help, then Shufharz' arrival can be expatiated, and she can be present when the party emerges from the cellar.
  - If she is locked in a room, Hope can have shouted out one of her windows for help, to get attention.
  - If she is unconscious (or worse), have one guard patrol pass by with a trained dog whose attention was drawn to the tavern.

### Taking the Deal

If the party [exchanged information for Carlton's freedom](./07-infiltrating-the-hideout.md#carltons-hq) earlier, then there will be no guard presence at street level when the party re-emerges.
If Hope is around, the party will have to lie that they did not find Fordem down in the cellar either (he will be gone with Carlton when the guard eventually turn up and investigate themselves).
