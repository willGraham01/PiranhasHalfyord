# Infiltrating the Hideout

Having participated in Shufharz' reverse-heist plan, the party follows the trail back to the Day's Rest, where they need to apprehend the Piranha's leadership before they get wind of the events that have transpired.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides a final set of clues as to the Piranhas' and Groubun's plan.
- Serves as the climax of the story, with the party facing down Shark Carlton.
- Serves as a short dungeon crawl.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have confronted Carlton and Fordem.
- Have discovered Whiskers' true identity, and possibly how to cure him.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- There are details in the hideout showing that the Piranhas are preparing false evidence to plant against Faire.
  - Carlton may barter this information with the party.
  - There will be a desk where the gang is copying a ledger to leave behind, replacing Groubun's alias with Faire's name in the copy.

The party will arrive on the scene in potentially two ways, and the contents of the hideout will vary depending on how the events at the docks unfolded.

## Setting

This scene takes place in:

- The Day's Rest tavern
- The Piranha's hideout

The party will likely arrive at the scene in one of two ways;

- Via the streets, overground, in pursuit of either animated loot or gang members following events at the docks. They may also be following the trail from the Ring of Seeking.
- Via the sewers, if the party is quick enough to follow the animated loot before it reaches the vault and the rear entrance is sealed.

In the latter case, the party will enter this scene in the Piranhas' vault, jump to the [relevant event](#the-vault).
The party will likely not have Whiskers with them, but the scene setup is otherwise identical.

The party's expected manner of arrival is via the streets and the main entrance to the Day's Rest.
The streets will not be particularly busy, since it is the middle of the working day at this point.
The tavern door will not be locked, but it will be clear from the outside that it is not yet open, and the bouncer will not be present on the door.

If the animated loot travelled via the streets, then there will be a commotion en route to the tavern, and the citizens in the streets will exclaim about what they are witnessing / have witnessed.
Depending on the events of the previous scene, use the relevant event to determine what the party arrives to:

- If the animated loot travelled via the sewers, and all gang members successfully fled without being chased: [All Calm](#all-calm).
- If the animated loot travelled via the sewers, but gang members were tailed back: [Unexpected Guests](#unexpected-guests).
- If the animated loot travelled via the streets, but all gang members successfully fled without being chased: [Magic Monsters](#magic-monsters).
- If the animated loot travelled via the streets, and gang members were tailed back: [The Jig is Up](#the-jig-is-up).

The specific situation will affect the state of affairs that the party arrives to, however in each case look for an opportunity to place Whiskers somewhere in the scene.
He can join when the party enters the tavern and begins talking to Hope, and can even start making sounds to get Hope's attention if the party tries sneaking around the tavern too much.
He can also be used as a guide of sorts to steer the party towards potential solutions to getting into the cellar.

In any case, the party needs to gain access to the cellar (if they haven't already).
Hope's key doesn't unlock the cellar, so she can't provide direct access.
The party will need to either discover the [hidden key in Fordem's room](./05-the-days-rest-tavern.md#fordems-room), use a key if they managed to steal one from the night before, break the cellar lock to get in, or find another way.
Inventive solutions for getting through the cellar door (using either the alcohol behind the bar or supplies from the kitchen) should also be allowed.

- (Thieves' Tools DC 18) To pick the cellar lock.
- (Investigation DC 12) Searching the small storage area between the common area and Fordem's room will reveal a crowbar in amongst the other supplies. It can be used to help with forcing the cellar door.
- (Strength DC 17) (Automatic: Crowbar or other suitable tool) To force the cellar door lock, and provide access to the cellar.

Once the party gains access to the cellar, move to [Entering the Cellar](#entering-the-cellar).

### All Calm

In this eventuality, Fordem will be in the cellar with Carlton, planning the transport of the vault contents (and Piranhas members) out of Halfyord.
None of the gang members will have returned to the hideout, so they will not be present to complicate matters later.

Hope will be in either the common area or kitchen, cleaning and getting the tavern ready for the evening.
She will have dutifully filled Whiskers' feeding bowl, but naturally he will not have eaten from it.

Hope will assume the party are overly-eager patrons (possibly even recognising them from the night before) and if they walk in, will mention that the tavern opens later in the evening.
She can be convinced to co-operate with the party (if the party still have Shufharz' seal that was given before they went to the Ordo, for example), or persuaded / convinced by other means to co-operate.
If the party asks where Fordem is, or otherwise broaches a topic of conversation that Hope would need to ask Fordem about, Hope will suddenly realise she hasn't seen Fordem in a while.
She will brush this off with him likely being in his office or down in the cellar looking for stock, but will be certain that he hasn't left the tavern.

### Unexpected Guests

In this situation, gang members who were present at the heist have been tracked back to the hideout, realising that it was a setup and wanting to warn Fordem.
These gang members will have arrived at the tavern slightly ahead of the party, and Fordem will have sensed the danger and waved them into the cellar with him.
These gang members will bolster the numbers that are already present in the hideout.

Hope will have noticed the commotion, but Fordem will give the excuse that the gang members who have turned up are here to pick up a faulty delivery of ale.
However, she will notice that Fordem will lock the cellar behind him, and Whiskers will be visibly agitated.
She will share this information with the party if they are upfront with their reasons for wanting to investigate.

### Magic Monsters

Though gang members were not successfully tracked to the tavern, Animated Loot was forced to travel overground and has thus burst into the tavern, aiming for the cellar.
Fordem - recognising the exposure risk to the gang's hideout - has opened the cellar under the guise of "leading" the dangerous creatures away from the tavern floor.

Hope will have seen the Animated Loot burst in and heard Fordem's fake cry of "I'm trapping it in the cellar" (or a suitable variation of that to the same effect).
She will be shaken and panicked, and will be found running out of the tavern shouting for help when the party reaches the tavern.
She will accept help from the party and explain the version of events that she believes, though reluctant to allow them to re-open the cellar for fear of letting the creatures out (though she will also be concerned for Fordem's safety).
Otherwise, she will be willing to assist the party in gaining access to the cellar.

In this situation, and after having heard the version of events from Hope, the party members can make a (hearing-based) check when in the vicinity of the cellar door:

- (Perception DC 15) No sounds can be heard coming from behind the cellar door. There are no cries of help, heightened breathing, or sounds of a struggle.
  - On a failure, simply say that the door is too thick to permit any sound to travel through.

### The Jig Is Up

In this situation, both Animated Loot and gang members have come back to the hideout.
Fordem will realise this means that the jig is up, and will have taken everyone into the cellar without trying to explain anything to Hope.

Hope will be both confused and scared when the party turns up.
She will relay what she witnessed from the kitchen - the Animated Loot bursting into the tavern and the gang members shortly afterwards, followed by Fordem letting them into the cellar.
Fordem will have said nothing to her in this time, barely realising that she witnessed these events due to busily trying to usher everything into the cellar and hideout.

Hope requires less convincing than in the other cases to help, if she can be reassured about the party's motivations.

## Entering the Cellar

After opening the cellar door, the party will almost have access to the hideout.
Switch to the [hideout map](../setting.md#mapped-locations) if you are using it.
A staircase leads down one floor / story from the cellar door, into a square room.
There are no lit light sources in the room, though there is an unlit torch sconce at the bottom of the stairs.
Whiskers will come down into the cellar with the party, but Hope will refuse to join the group.

On the wall to the left of the stairs are barrels that contain alcohol and other beverages that are sold at the tavern, but also contain some ingredients that the party might recognise as valuable alchemical ingredients / spell components.

- (Strength DC 10) (ADV: Crowbar or other suitable tool) To open any of the barrels on this floor.
- (Survival DC 14) (Arcana DC 14) To identify the "normal" alcoholic substances, and to identify the barrels that contain alchemical ingredients.
  - 16+: If the party took interest in Groubun's potion ingredients [yesterday at the Ordo](./03-visiting-the-ordo-magicae.md), to identify the alchemical ingredients as those that Groubun was using in the lab the previous day, or using in his recent batch of experiments.

The wall opposite the staircase is actually hollow, and hides the entrance to the Piranhas' hideout.
This wall is partially obstructed by crates and smaller pallets, and there is one of the gang's marks on the wall. FIXME: image?
There will be splintered wood and scratch marks on the stone floor near the hollow wall.

- Unless the party arrived to [all calm](#all-calm), these smaller crates and pallets will appear to have been moved to the side, exposing the opposite wall.
- (Investigation DC 13) (Perception DC 13) (Automatic: The wall is exposed) (ADV: At least one gang mark has been found before) To notice the gang mark in the hollow wall.
  - The gang mark is etched into the wall, rather than being "drawn" on like the others the party has encountered before. It appears to be very simple in its design, just in the shape of a tooth with no further markings. FIXME: image?
    - (History DC 11) The tooth shape is remarkably similar in size and design to the necklace ornaments that have been found on fallen Piranhas members.
  - 15+: To identify the portion of the hollow wall that "opens" when the hole provided by the gang mark is filled.

If the party has a gang necklace to hand, they can insert it into the hole provided by the gang mark and this will open a section of the hollow wall, providing access to the hideout's [recreation room](#recreation-room).
If the party does not have a gang symbol to hand, they will need to find one.
Note that the necklaces scattered about the tavern are deliberately not available in the previous visit, to ensure there is always one available here to provide access to the cellar without the need for a lengthy trip across town to fetch Shufharz.

- The guest bedrooms housed Piranhas' members last night, and one of them will have left a necklace on the dressing table.
  - Hope can provide a key to the room, or the locks can be picked as per the checks described [in the party's previous visit](./05-the-days-rest-tavern.md#guest-rooms).
  - If the party arrived to [Unexpected Guests](#unexpected-guests) or [the Jig is Up](#the-jig-is-up), Hope (if asked) will mention that she thinks she recognised one of the gang members who arrived from the night before, as someone Fordem had rented a room to.

Whiskers can be used to provide additional context clues, beyond the scrape marks on the floor.
The Ring of Seeking will lead through the wall too, if it is still tracking one of the Animated Loot, giving further hints that the cellar does not end with the room the party finds themselves in.
Other methods of getting through the wall should also be rewarded:

- If the party has a means of replicating the tooth design from the wood splinters on the floor, allow them a check to do this and then place this replica into the gang mark slot.
- If the party has identified the opening in the wall, they can try to simply break down the wall to access the hideout.
  - (Strength DC 20) To create a vulnerability in the wall that can be further worked into an opening. This will take about 1 minute of effort.
  - Allow the use of spells, potions, or other suitable substances to break through the wall.

Once through the hollow wall, the party will enter the hideout proper, finding themselves in the [recreation room](#recreation-room).

## Recreation Room

On the opposite side of the wall that opens out of the cellar will be a common or recreation room of sorts.
This area is well-lit, contrary to the cellar, and looks like it sees regular use - there will be furniture placed around the room, a small kitchen-like area, and several bookcases and desks.
The desk directly opposite the entrance from the cellar will have the gang's coded logbook, and the unencrypted copy that they are creating as fake evidence against Faire.
The table in the middle / centre of the room will have [Carlton's letter to Groubun](#carltons-letter) on it, asking for the [potion to revert Faire's form](../items/potion-of-corporeal-resetting.md).
The board will also have recent additions to the usual gang marks, including one that has been recently added to implicate Faire.

There will be at least two gang members present in the recreation room.
If [Unexpected Guests](#unexpected-guests) or [the Jig is Up](#the-jig-is-up) occurred, the gang members that were tracked back from the docks will also be present here.
If any of these additional gang members were severely injured when they arrived, have those members start in the hideout barracks (having just settled down to try and recover from their injuries).

When the party enters the recreation room via the cellar, the gang members in the recreation room will be having a conversation, and they will all have their armour equipped and weapons to hand.
They will all be gathered at the far end of the room, near the kitchenette looking area and door leading to the barracks.
If the party enters carefully, they may be able to overhear part of their conversation.

If the party arrived to anything other than [All Calm](#all-calm);

- (Stealth DC 17) To enter the hideout without alerting the group of gang members, and reach a hiding space on the opposite of the room to the gang members.
  - To get closer to the gang members undetected will require further stealth checks, at an appropriate DC as dictated by player actions.
  - (Perception DC 10) To successfully listen in on the gang members' discussion. The character will overhear that Fordem has gone to see Carlton in his HQ, and usual activity in the hideout has been interrupted for the time being.
    - 11+ (only in the event of [Magic Monsters](#magic-monsters) or [The Jig is Up](#the-jig-is-up)): The same gang member will comment on the fact that one of the "potion animals" came in with Fordem, rather than the usual way via the sewer-connection to the vault.
    - 13+: One of the gang members will make an offhand comment that Fordem shouted this as he entered, and this caused him to spill ink over the copy of the logbook that they were working on. This is in reference to the logbook - currently resting on the desk opposite the cellar entrance - that the gang plans to use as "fake evidence" to pin the blame on Faire.
    - 16+: The other gang member will mention that Fordem looked very concerned, and the fact that they have been put on alert likely means the plans to leave Halfyord are being bought forward.

Otherwise, the two gang members that are present will be having a conversation across the room to each other.
One will be seated at the desk across from the cellar entryway, working on the fake logbook to plant on Faire as evidence.
The other will be sat at the table, sealing Carlton's letter and preparing to run an errand to delivery it.
The gang member working on the logbook will be expecting other gang members to return to the hideout from the heist at the docks, so will not be immediately weary when they hear / see the wall opening.
They will get suspicious if no-one they recognise appears through the gap after a short time though.

- (Stealth DC 10) The gang member working on the logbook does not clock the party's presence when the cellar wall opens out.
  - (Perception DC 10) To overhear the conversation between the gang members. The one at the desk will ask where the other is going, and the other gang member will respond by explaining Fordem is planning with Carlton in his HQ, and gave him a letter to deliver to the Ordo Magicae.
    - 13+: The gang member at the desk will mention that it looks like "everything is coming together", and soon they'll be leaving Halfyord with their pockets lined.
  - Once the party overhears this information, have the gang member at the desk look towards the cellar wall and shout a greeting to (what they presume) are more gang members arriving.

### Combat Encounter (Recreation Room)

Provoking the gang members in this room will lead to a combat with these gang members.
There are no special objectives for this combat, nor scaling of the number of gang members.
The gang members will be trying to kill the intruders, and the combat "reward" will be being able to explore the immediate area uninterrupted.

### Looking for Clues

After dealing with the gang members in the room (and possibly the adjoining barracks), the party can explore the area and might uncover the available clues.

#### Coded Logbook

The desk opposite the entrance from the cellar has the gang's coded logbook, and the un-encrypted copy that they are making to leave as fake evidence to implicate Faire.
The un-encrypted copy will not be complete, missing the entries in the actual (encrypted) logbook that record events from the previous 2 days.

- (Investigation DC 10) (ADV: Character overheard the gang members mention the logbook) To discover the two logbooks, side-by-side, and both open to a similar page. One appears to be incomplete, with the subsequent pages being blank, but the other appears to be filled out.
  - 12+: The filled out notebook appears to be encrypted, whereas the un-filled notebook is written in common and legible without the need of a cipher.
  - 15+: There are several references to Faire in the last few weeks in the un-encrypted logbook, and all of them mention either receipt of supplies or delivery of alchemical materials.
  - 17+: (Only if the encrypted logbook has been deciphered, do not require a re-roll if deciphering occurred after this check) There is a delivery entry in the encrypted logbook for yesterday evening, the symbol used for the delivery-person matches [Groubun's alias on the gang board](#gang-notice-board).
- (Intelligence DC 15) (ADV: Thieves' Cant / suitable feature involving codebreaking / the board with the gang marks has been discovered) To decipher the logbook, based on context clues. This does not provide complete translation, but provides a working understanding of what is in the notebook. It does highlight that Faire's name has replaced someone else's in the translation between the logbooks, however.

#### Carlton's Letter

On the table near the centre of the room will be a note that Carlton instructed to be delivered to Groubun, the text of which [can be found here](../items/carltons-letter-to-groubun.md).
It is sealed in an envelope that contains no text nor name - one of the gang members in the recreation room may mention that they were told to deliver it directly to Groubun at the Ordo, rather than posting it.
The letter is not encrypted nor written in Thieves' Cant, since Groubun needs to be able to read it.
However, it does not use names nor provide any other identifying information about the parties involved.

This letter contains a short note requesting that Groubun deliver the [potion that will restore Faire's form](../items/potion-of-corporeal-resetting.md), as the gang is beginning to leave Halfyord and frame Faire in the process.
It also mentions the conclusion of the arrangement between Groubun and the Piranhas gang.

#### Gang Notice Board

Hanging on one of the walls in the room is a notice board of sorts that the gang clearly uses for organisational purposes.
It contains a mixture of paper notes that are fixed to the board via nails or knives, and etched into the wood of the board itself is the legend for translating the gang marks that the Piranhas use to communicate.

A character inspecting the board will immediately notice that there is a key to the gang marks on this board (though if no gang marks were found, they might not necessarily know what these symbols mean).
The full key will be available to read, along with some marks that appear in the logbook and on the other notes on the board too.
Notable marks include; FIXME - make an image and collate all mentioned symbols into it!!!

- A mark for "leader", which is an alias for Carlton.
- A mark for "deputy", which is an alias for Fordem.
- A mark for "ally", which is an alias for Groubun.
- A mark that just says "ordinator", which is a planted alias for Faire.
  - (Investigation DC 10 / Survival DC 14) This mark was added much more recently than the others. It is drawn on rather than carved into the wood, and the paint is still slightly damp.
- A mark for "footpad" or "member", which is a generic alias for the lower members of the gang.
- (Investigation DC 10) All the other notes on the board are written in terms of these signs.
  - 11+: One note appears to have today's date, the word "docks", and a number of "footpad" symbols on it. The number of footpad symbols matches the number of gang members that were sent to the docks. If additional gang members were sent due to Groubun's suspicion, the character notices that there appear to have been additional "footpad"s added more recently.
  - 14+: One note appears to have yesterday's date, the symbol for "delivery", and the "ally" alias.

## The Barracks

The room that the Piranhas use as a barracks or armoury of sorts connects to the recreation room, on the wall opposite to the corridor leading to the vault and Carlton's HQ.
There may be a wounded gang member in one of the beds, depending on events at the docks and which situation the party arrived to.

The only notable item of relevance to the plot in this room is Whisker's broken cage, that he escaped out of before being "adopted" by Hope upstairs.
It is a fairly small box, slightly bigger than the box one might use to take cats on public transport or in cars, but is composed entirely of bars with a solid floor rather than having 3 solid walls and a door.

Inspecting the cage will reveal that it might have been fairly sturdy at one point, but it looks like the locking mechanism on the cage has been clawed at and broken away from the cage frame itself.
If Whiskers is with the party, he will growl angrily at the cage, indicating what its previous contents were.

## The Corridor

Exiting the recreational room via the door opposite the barracks will open into a narrow corridor.
Proceeding down the corridor is harmless, though the party might be weary of traps.
The two doors at the far end of the corridor lead to either Carlton's HQ or the vault.

The door to Carlton's HQ is relatively unassuming, and does not have any distinguishing markings to indicate it leads into the HQ.
It will not be locked when the party approaches, but when they move up to the door have Carlton call out to the party, inviting them to parley.

Across from the door to the HQ is the vault door - it has a heavy lock on it, and thick iron bars across it.
The vault door requires two keys to be inserted into it simultaneously to be opened from the corridor - one of these keys is carried by Fordem and Carlton each.
The party may already have Fordem's key if they stole it from him when they visited the Day's Rest Tavern or found the spare key in his upstairs room.
The two locks are distinct, so placing one copy of Fordem's key into each of the two keyholes will not unlock the vault, and will trigger the trap as below.

- (Thieves' Tools DC 25) To unlock one of the two vault locks without the required key.
  - On failure: The character attempting to unlock the vault door takes 1d8 lightning damage as the metallic components of the door begin to conduct a harmful electric current. An alarm siren briefly sounds too. Fordem and Carlton will be alerted to the group's presence if they weren't already, and in any event will comment on the futility of opening the vault without the key and invite the party to parley.

The vault door can be unlocked from the inside by pulling a release lever next to the door.
This will temporarily open the vault door, but it will automatically close and lock after 30 seconds.

## The Vault

Inside the vault are most of the valuables that the gang has managed to steal since Groubun begun assisting them.
Any Animated Loot that made it from the docks will be standing idly in the room (even if not via the sewers), they will not react to the party's entry.
If the party manages to infiltrate the sewers they will enter directly into the vault, via the sewer entrance that the Animated Loot used.

There will be a small horde of valuables in the vault; the party might recognise some of the valuables as those that have gone missing if Shufharz and Kamonas were asked about this earlier.
The majority of these will be packed into wooden crates (currently unsealed) with the lids off and laid beside the crates they fit onto.
The party may well attempt to acquire some of this wealth for themselves, however be sure to comment that very little of what is in the vault is actually in coins - it is mostly in items like jewellery, paintings, ornaments and the like, which would need to be fenced and are unwieldy to transport.
If the party persist, allow them to take items worth a total value of 2d6+1 gold pieces each, and make a comment that the Animated Loot that is in the vault with them starts to twitch.
If the party attempts to take any more items out of the vault, have the Animated Loot turn on them, and the vault alarm sound.
The party's reward at the end of the adventure will also be smaller, since Kamonas' accountants and scribes will note the missing deficit and determine that the gang must have made off with some of the valuables before the party arrived.

- If the vault alarm sounds in this way, have Carlton and Fordem make another comment like the one described in [the corridor](#the-corridor). If the party does not immediately take up this offer of parley, they will come through the HQ door (with the Piranha taxidermy already animated) and attack, offering no quarter.
  - If the party entered via the sewers, there may also be gang members in the recreation room. In this case, have these gang members enter the corridor when Carlton and Fordem make their offer of parley (Carlton will tell them to hold for the time being). Aggressive actions towards these gang members will make Fordem and Carlton join the fight as per the text above. Otherwise, they will follow the party into the HQ when they accept the parley offer, and potentially join the fight that ensues.

If the party did not enter via the sewers, a character inspecting the room can notice the one-way hatch in the ceiling.

- (Investigation DC 10) To notice the one-way trapdoor in the ceiling.
- (Perception DC 10) There is a lingering smell of waste and sewage in the vault.

## Carlton's HQ

Carlton and Fordem will be in the HQ, and the party will need to open the door to trigger the final confrontation.
Carlton may have invited the party in for parley depending on how they acted in the vault or corridor, or the party's entry might take the two of them by surprise.
Regardless, they will not be immediately hostile unless the party comes into the room guns blazing.

When the party enters, Carlton will be sitting at the desk directly ahead of them, and Fordem will initially be next to the desk, seemingly pointing to something on the desk.
Fordem is pointing to a map of the sewer system that is laid out across Carlton's desk, which is being weighed down (to prevent it curling up) by a candle on one corner and a [potion of animating](../items/potion-of-animating.md) on the other corner.
Fordem will move away from the desk towards the door to Carlton's room for cover as the conversation progresses, picking up a wand as he does, but will not take any outwardly hostile actions.
Whiskers will hiss angrily at Carlton and Fordem when he enters, which will prompt an offhand comment from one of them.
Carlton will then engage the group in the promised parley.

- (Perception DC 19) (Arcana DC 19) To notice / identify that Fordem picks up a wand from Carlton's desk. The spells stored in the wand cannot be deduced via this check.

Carlton and Fordem at this point will be happy to escape with their lives and freedom, and are unconcerned about taking the gang's stash with them.
Depending on the party's knowledge, Carlton and Fordem may have information they can trade for their freedom.
In exchange, they will request that the party leave the hideout and report it as empty to Shufharz - Carlton and Fordem will be gone by the time the guard turn up to secure the area.
They will use the time between the party leaving to report to Shufharz and the guard arriving to exit to the boat waiting in the sewers (accessible via Carlton's room) and escape Halfyord.

Carlton and Fordem can reveal (and are willing to trade) the following information:

- That Groubun was the one supplying them with potions and other magical assistance.
  - (Persuasion DC 18) To get Carlton to offer up this information as a sign of goodwill behind his parley offer.
  - Whiskers will meow in confusion and shock at this revelation.
- If it is clear that the party knows that Groubun was in on the plot, Carlton and Fordem can offer up the details of the arrangement.
  - They will explain everything short of how they were planning to turn Faire back into an elf at the end of everything. If the party did not find the logbook copy, "fake" gang mark on the notice board, or letter in the recreation room, Carlton can offer these to be used as evidence (and explain their purpose).
- If the party already has sufficient evidence to explain the plot, Carlton and Fordem will offer up the cure for Faire's condition that they know of. They will also reveal that it will wipe his memory of being a cat.
  - If asked how the cure can be altered, Carlton and Fordem will dismiss the question because they don't know the answer. They will suggest - now that the party knows the cure has this property - asking members of the Ordo how to do this.

If all of the above fail, have Carlton pretend to offer a bribe to the party in exchange for their silence.
Whilst he is "negotiating" with the party, have Fordem initiate combat by taking an action, then roll initiative.

If the party accepts Carlton's deal, Groubun **looses** 2 suspicion points (meaning the party may potentially have time to apprehend him).
These points should be given back to his total if the party attacks Carlton (or otherwise goes back on their word) after making a deal to get the information Carlton offered.

### Encounter Information

Trigger: Parley fails, or the party conducts a hostile action.
Intended difficulty: Medium / Hard

Participants:

- [Shark Carlton](../characters/shark-carlton.md)
- [Fordem Chev](../characters/fordem-chev.md)
- 1 Animated Piranha

Enemy Objectives:

- Kill or subdue the party, this is the only route to freedom!

#### Initial Locations

The fight takes place in Carlton's HQ room.

- Carlton will start behind his desk.
- Fordem will start in the doorway to Carlton's room from the HQ.
- The Animated Piranha starts as a piece of taxidermy on the wall to the right of the entrance from [the corridor](#the-corridor). Carlton or Fordem will animate it on their first turn.

#### Other Encounter Factors

- This is a fight to the death, surrender is beyond Carlton and Fordem at this point.
  - Carlton and Fordem can be knocked unconscious, if the party wishes to take them alive. They will obviously attempt to escape if they are not bound and restrained when they come to conciousness.
- Carlton will activate their ring on turn 1.
- Fordem will pick up a wand from the desk that lets him cast Counterspell once, Hold Person once, and Dispel Magic twice, before the wand is exhausted and breaks. The spell DC of the wand is 15, otherwise use Fordem's Intelligence as his casting stat to determine any necessary attack roll bonuses. The wand cannot be recharged and breaks if Fordem exhausts all the charges in it.
- Whoever acts first between Fordem and Carlton will animate the piranha on the wall, bringing it into the fight.
  - Roll initiative for the Animated Piranha before the fight breaks out, but skip its turn if it acts before it can be animated.
  - Carlton can kick his desk over to propel the potion towards the wall to achieve this.
  - Fordem can do this using the wand he has picked up off the desk (to add some flavour to the wand). In this case, have the potion on Carlton's desk be spilled harmlessly during the fight.
- Additional gang members may be present if the party did not deal with the group in the [recreation room](#recreation-room).

#### Loot

- Carlton has his two scimitars, and his golden tooth necklace. The blink ring and pistols can also be looted but will need repair before they are in a usable state.
- Fordem has his weapons and gold tooth necklace.
- The party is then free to loot the room(s).

### Search the HQ

Once the fight is over, the party can freely search the HQ, and Carlton's adjoining room, for the remaining clues.

- Carlton's desk has a master key for the hideout and cellar.
  - If the desk was knocked over during the fight, these items may be on the floor.
  - (Thieves' Tools DC 16) (AUTO: Carlton's master key) To open the desk drawers, which are locked.
    - One of the desk draws has a note from Groubun (which does not identify his person), giving instructions for the use of the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md) and the runic key to unlock it.
  - On the desk is a map of the sewers (that Fordem was pointing to earlier). A route is drawn in red, that starts from a tooth mark and appears to end outside Halfyord's city walls.
- Carlton's room has further loot:
  - The bedside table has the collar key on it.
  - A chest at the end of Carlton's bed contains some nice clothes, a few gems, and a coin pouch.
    - Gems: (party size * 2) pearls worth 25GP each.
    - Coins: (party size)d4s gold pieces are found.
    - Clothes: A shirt of mending can be found in the chest.
  - Carlton's weapon rack has a rapier and a short-sword that can be taken.
  - (Perception DC 15) (Survival DC 14) (Nature DC 17) (Investigation DC 16) To identify a small crack in the far wall, from which an unpleasant smell is coming.
    - Pressing against this crack will cause the section of wall to turn as if on hinges, revealing an entrance into a sewer tunnel. A small boat with a pair of oars is floating on top of the sewage thoroughfare, moored to a pole. The thoroughfare, if followed, leads out beyond the city walls into a rather unclear pond.
