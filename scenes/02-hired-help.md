# The Magistrate's Office

After the attack in the market, Shufharz takes the party to the magistrates office to enlist their help, and fill them in on the situation.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Serves as a party debrief for the adventure, introducing the key characters & the planted cargo scheme.
- Provides the motivations of Shufharz and Kamonas for wanting the gang gone.
- Provides a "flashback" excuse for bestowing additional information to the party.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Understand their objective.
- Follow up their leads at the Ordo Magicae and Docks.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Any information surrounding the fall of the Piranhas (from Kamonas or Shufharz).
- The identifying necklaces of the Piranhas (if not known already).
- The general mood in Halfyord in light of the Piranha's resurgence.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Magistrates Office. A small portion may take place in the walk to the magistrates office.

The party will walk down [Governor's Walk](../setting.md#the-magistrates-office-and-barracks) with Shufharz after the attack on the market square.
The street will be bustling with activity, guards taking witness statements, and crowds kept at a distance from the crime scene in the market.
Several merchants will also be relocating their goods in light of recent events.

When the party enters the Magistrates office, the city council will not be in session but a heated debate will be heard from the council chamber floor.
Kamonas will be waiting in her office on the first floor of the building.

## The Walk from the Market

During the walk to the Magistrate's office, the party has a chance to overhear some conversations between the citizens of Halfyord.
These don't have any effect on the story, but do serve to provide some world-building and emphasise the extent of Halfyord's problems.

Have everyone in the party roll one of the following checks (of their choice) at a DC of 10, obtaining the following information if they pass:

- Insight: The character picks up on a general sense of dread, fear, and anger from the crowd. Wealthier citizens are talking back to the guards, asking questions like "how are we supposed to feel safe in our own homes?" and "what's the guard going to do about it?". The merchant class are going about their business quickly, as if to avoid spending as much time on the street as possible. There are several lower class citizens already deep in their cups.
- Perception: A number of merchants and nobles are accompanied by bodyguard or mercenary types. More so than one would expect, especially on the main street of town. The homes along the street look opulent, but are devoid of decoration, as if the occupants are trying to hide the fact that they have the wealth to do so.
- Investigation: A character notices that the guards moving through the crowd taking statements are asking similar questions to everyone, but getting unhelpful answers. Most people seem cooperative but have nothing to add. A couple of guards can be seen to compare notes, and give each other resigned sighs before continuing to take statements.

If a player gives a good roleplaying reason, allow them to make an appropriate check to discover some of the information above.
Or feel free to make up another interaction they can observe based on their check and/or actions.

Once the party reaches the Magistrate's building, Shufharz will pass the door guards and take them inside.
If none of the party members managed to discern the information above, have Shufharz be accosted by a member of the city council as the party enters - use the information available from the insight check above as a guideline for this interaction.
Shufharz will do her best to sidestep the question, and push passed the noble and head for Kamonas' office.
The party can attempt to overhear some of the conversation in the council chamber before they should follow on after Shufharz.

- (Perception / Stealth DC 10) A character can overhear, or get close enough to overhear, the conversation in the council chamber. It is mostly a lot of shouting, but the character can discern that there is no clear agreement about what to do to combat the recent crisis, nor even where to start.
  - 12+: Phrases like "are the Piranhas really back?" and "I thought they were wiped out" can be picked out from the general din.
  - 15+: Some nobles can be heard calling Kamonas' and Shufharz' leadership into question.

## Brief with the Governor

After making their way to Kamonas' office, Shufharz will give a brief introduction and fill Kamonas in on the situation.
Depending on Shufharz's disposition towards the party, she can recommend them for involvement in the upcoming heist tomorrow, or if Shufharz's disposition is negative then Kamonas can play the "we need people who won't have been gotten to" card.
If the party asks for a reward, have Kamonas delay with a response of "if you help us recover the missing treasury, I'm sure we could arrange something" - or something to that effect.
If the party really presses for an upfront reward, have Shufharz offer them the bounty on Carlton's head in addition to what the town treasury can spare - but only if they bring Carlton in.

The pair will then brief the party on the situation in Halfyord, as described in the background.
They should give the details of the last month (since Faire's disappearance and the Piranha's resurgence) before opening the floor to party questions.

- Shufharz and Kamonas will answer any questions the party has about the gang to the best of their abilities.
- They will also answer questions about the town and important characters if requested.
- When first mentioning or discussing Faire, have Shufharz give some indication of disapproval (a huff or talking through slightly gritted teeth). If asked, Shufharz and Kamonas will be honest about their opinions of Faire, and share their initial suspicion that he might be out to prove a point.

Once that has been done, and the party's agreement secured, have Shufharz tell the party about the plan for tomorrow.
Also have her mention that they are waiting on an item from Jenessa at the Ordo Magicae.
Additionally, if he hasn't come up in conversation yet, have Shufharz suggest that the party talk to Groubun if they run into him at the Ordo about the magic the party saw used in the market attack.
Shufharz will then request that the party meet her at the docks to do some reconnaissance for tomorrow, and will give the party a seal to show to Jenessa to confirm they are working with the town guard.
Importantly, stress to the party that this seal is not legal immunity!

If the party say that they want to wait for Shufharz to visit the docks together, then go on to the Ordo, have her make the excuse that she has to appear before the city council to give a report.
This will take a while, and it will likely mean that the Ordo Magicae will be closed by the time the party is done scouting out the docks - so better for the party to get things rolling there whilst Shufharz is stuck with the politicians.

## Next Scenes

The party should proceed to [Visiting the Ordo Magicae](./03-visiting-the-ordo-magicae.md) after this scene.
