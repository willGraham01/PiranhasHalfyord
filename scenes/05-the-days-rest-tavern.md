# Scene name

The party trails Groubun from the Docks, suspicious of where he is heading.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Fordem, Hope, and Whiskers.
- Provides further opportunities for throwing suspicion on Groubun.
- A chance for social investigation.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have their suspicions of Groubun confirmed. Or at least suspect that Groubun is engaging in some kind of illicit business at the tavern.
- Have had a chance to meet Whiskers, and talk to Hope (and potentially Fordem) about the tavern.
- Have had an opportunity to look around the Day's Rest Tavern.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Hope can be engaged in friendly conversation to learn about her backstory, but also information she knows about the tavern.
  - She will mention the sale and that she remembers the old owner if asked.
  - She knows that the old owner sold in a hurry, since he was apparently paying off a debt. (This was of course, coercion on Fordem and the Piranhas' part).
- Fordem will also share information about the tavern, but be less forthcoming with his information than Hope.
  - He will not rent a room to the party, claiming they are fully booked tonight.
  - He will give his (public-facing) origin story for finding Whiskers, but this will be at odds with how Whiskers seems to behave towards him. Fordem's barkeeper act will play into this, saying Whiskers seems to prefer Hope despite Fordem taking him in.
- If the draft diagram for the Confining Collar was found in the Ordo Magicae, the party may recognise it on Whiskers.
- Interacting with Whiskers may lead an observant character to suspect he's no ordinary cat.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Day's Rest Tavern

As the party follows Groubun on his journey through the streets from the docks, it will quickly become apparent that he is not heading to the temple (the only plausible location if he previously gave his "healing salve" excuse).
He will lead the party to the Day's Rest tavern.

When they arrive, the tavern will be busy and noisy.
There will be a bouncer on the door and the sound of music and chatter coming from inside the tavern.
Groubun will be waved in by the bouncer when he arrives, the party will have to give up their weapons before they enter.

The tavern itself sits on one corner of a 4-way junction.
It is a large, 2-story structure which is attached on one side to what looks to be terraced houses along one of the streets leading up to the junction.
There is a narrow alleyway that runs from the street along the tavern wall, which a window in the tavern's kitchen opens out into.

The door to the tavern opens out into a large hall or common room.
There is a hearth on one of the walls with a fire going, and the bar backs onto the wall on the right of the doorway upon entering.
Along from the bar (moving away from the entryway) is the door to the kitchen, and along the same wall in the opposite direction is a small doorway that leads to a staircase and the owner's room.

The area opposite the bar has little floor space, mostly being taken up by tables of varying sizes.
A staircase leads to a mezzanine level that overlooks the table area and bar, where some more seating can be found and a band / musician can be found playing.
The upper level also leads to the restroom and the rooms for rent.

It's the end of a working day and the tavern is busy.
Most tables are full with patrons, with most of them being from the working classes of Halfyord.
There is some seating at the bar - Groubun will be at one stool, talking to Fordem who will be pretending to serve.
The mezzanine level will have a live band playing, whilst on the main floor Hope will be serving drinks and food, or preparing such in the kitchen.
Whiskers will be walking around in his usual plight, but will start in the kitchen until he realises Fordem and Groubun are present.
