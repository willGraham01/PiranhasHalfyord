# Scene name

The party trails Groubun from the Docks, suspicious of where he is heading.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Fordem, Hope, and Whiskers.
- Provides further opportunities for throwing suspicion on Groubun.
- A chance for social investigation.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have their suspicions of Groubun confirmed. Or at least suspect that Groubun is engaging in some kind of illicit business at the tavern.
- Have had a chance to meet Whiskers, and talk to Hope (and potentially Fordem) about the tavern.
- Have had an opportunity to look around the Day's Rest Tavern.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Hope can be engaged in friendly conversation to learn about her backstory, but also information she knows about the tavern.
  - She will mention the sale and that she remembers the old owner if asked.
  - She knows that the old owner sold in a hurry, since he was apparently paying off a debt. (This was of course, coercion on Fordem and the Piranhas' part).
- Fordem will also share information about the tavern, but be less forthcoming with his information than Hope.
  - He will not rent a room to the party, claiming they are fully booked tonight.
  - He will give his (public-facing) origin story for finding Whiskers, but this will be at odds with how Whiskers seems to behave towards him. Fordem's barkeeper act will play into this, saying Whiskers seems to prefer Hope despite Fordem taking him in.
- If the draft diagram for the Confining Collar was found in the Ordo Magicae, the party may recognise it on Whiskers.
- Interacting with Whiskers may lead an observant character to suspect he's no ordinary cat.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Day's Rest Tavern

As the party follows Groubun on his journey through the streets from the docks, it will quickly become apparent that he is not heading to the temple (the only plausible location if he previously gave his "healing salve" excuse).
He will lead the party to the Day's Rest tavern.

When they arrive, the tavern will be busy and noisy.
There will be a bouncer on the door and the sound of music and chatter coming from inside the tavern.
Groubun will be waved in by the bouncer when he arrives, the party will have to give up their weapons before they enter.

The tavern itself sits on one corner of a 4-way junction.
It is a large, 2-story structure which is attached on one side to what looks to be terraced houses along one of the streets leading up to the junction.
There is a narrow alleyway that runs from the street along the tavern wall, which a window in the tavern's kitchen opens out into.

The door to the tavern opens out into a large hall or common room.
There is a hearth on one of the walls with a fire going, and the bar backs onto the wall on the right of the doorway upon entering.
Along from the bar (moving away from the entryway) is the door to the kitchen, and along the same wall in the opposite direction is a small doorway that leads to a staircase and the owner's room.

The area opposite the bar has little floor space, mostly being taken up by tables of varying sizes.
A staircase leads to a mezzanine level that overlooks the table area and bar, where some more seating can be found and a band / musician can be found playing.
The upper level also leads to the restroom and the rooms for rent.

It's the end of a working day and the tavern is busy.
Most tables are full with patrons, with most of them being from the working classes of Halfyord.
There is some seating at the bar - Groubun will be at one stool, talking to Fordem who will be pretending to serve.
The mezzanine level will have a live band playing, whilst on the main floor Hope will be serving drinks and food, or preparing such in the kitchen.
Whiskers will be walking around in his usual plight, but will start in the kitchen until he realises Fordem and Groubun are present.

## Arriving at the Tavern

There will be a bouncer at the door who will insist on taking the party's weapons before they enter.
Mention that there looks to be a fairly secure cabinet located just to the side of the entrance that already houses weapons of varying degrees of care and sophistication, to ease the party's worries.
The bouncer will also take obvious magical foci; such as staffs, crystal balls, wands etc off the party members too.
He will not take away magical foci that are not used by Wizards - such as druidic foci used by rangers or druids, an artificer's tools, or the holy symbol of a paladin or cleric (unless this is attached to a weapon or shield, of course).
If one member of the party has their magical focus taken away, and another does not, have each character in the party roll either an insight or arcana check:

- (Insight DC 12) When asking for the party's weapons, the bouncer did not ask for the magical foci with the same fluency or professionalism, almost like he was having to remember what to list off or isn't familiar with these items.
  - 17+: The character clocks that the magical foci not confiscated are the those that are typically used by Wizards or Artificers.
- (Arcana DC 12) The character clocks that the magical foci not confiscated are the those that are typically used by Wizards or Artificers.
  - 17+: The character also clocks that the way the magical foci were listed was very illogical, as if the bouncer was trying to remember all the items on a list but had to skip over some entries and fill in the gaps later.

The bouncer will not let the party into the tavern without them surrendering their weapons and foci.
They can of course attempt to smuggle weapons or foci into the tavern, or they can attempt to convince the bouncer they should be allowed to take "holdout" weapons (such as daggers or small clubs) in for self-defence reasons.

- (Stealth DC 16) To smuggle a small concealed weapon, such as a dagger, light hammer, etc, in without the bouncer noticing.
  - Increase the DC of this check for more obvious weapon-smuggling attempts.
- (Persuasion DC 17) The bouncer can be convinced to let the party take holdout weapons into the tavern, but will still insist on taking their other weapons and foci.

Once inside the tavern, the party have several options.
Have them all make a perception check as they enter the tavern:

- (Perception DC 8) A character can notice Groubun at the bar, talking to the bartender (Fordem).
  - 10+: If they stay standing in the doorway for a while, they might draw the attention of the patrons - in particular Groubun - which may be detrimental to the party's objectives. They may want to find somewhere to sit.
  - 12+: There is a game of cards being played out on one of the tables in the common area. It seems that a round has just finished and several of the players are leaving the table, opening up space for new players to sit.
  - 14+: There looks to be a small ring of chalk on the floor in one corner of the common area, where there is a small crowd and a bookie. Two people who look like tavern brawlers look like they are participating in fisticuffs.
  - 16+: There is a small table of patrons who look like they have been at the end of the their drinks for a while, and will be leaving a free table soon.
  - 17+: Music can be heard from the upper mezzanine level, and there looks to be a fairly large crowd up there enjoying the performance.

The party will of course still be in the tavern entryway at this point, and if they dawdle for too long there Fordem, Groubun, Hope, or a patron of the tavern will draw attention to them for just standing around in the entryway and blocking the door.
Depending on how the check above went, the party might attempt to blend in by joining the game of cards going on at one table, or to head up to the mezzanine level to "enjoy" the music, or attempting to secure the soon-to-be-empty table.
Specific party members may also have other means of blending in (a bard might try to join the band playing, for example).
Wherever the party decides to blend in, have them roll a group stealth check (DC 10) to avoid Groubun's attention.

If the party elects to confront Groubun, he will claim to be visiting Fordem (on his way to the temple, if the bottles are questioned).
Fordem will come across to "save" him a short way into this conversation, and attempt to lead him into the kitchen to later get him into the cellar. Interacting directly with Groubun in any way causes him to gain a suspicion point.
He also gains this suspicion point if he becomes aware of the party's presence in the tavern (and this stacks with the point he may have acquired from noticing the party tailing him).

From here, there are several events that can happen.
It is a good idea to alternate resolving "serious" / "plot relevant" events with "role-playing" / flavourful events to give some idea of the passage of time or activities.
You can even have the role-playing events give benefits or hindrances to the other events, depending on how the party acts in each.

The plot relevant ("PR") events are:

FIXME these ToCs auto-format!!
- [Meeting Whiskers](#meeting-whiskers).
- [Groubun's Visit](#groubuns-visit).
- [Poking Around](#poking-around).
- [Don't tread on the fish](#dont-tread-on-the-fish).

whilst the role-playing ("RP") events are:

- [A Game of Cards?](#a-game-of-cards)
- [Fighting Ring](#fighting-ring)
- [An Admirable Performance](#an-admirable-performance)

## Meeting Whiskers

## Groubun's Visit

## Poking Around

## A Game of Cards?

Joining the table with the card game going offers the opportunity for some gambling.
If you have a means of simulating a dice game, then feel free to use this here.
The other players - patrons of the tavern - each only have around 5 SP to play with (total, for the entire playing session).
But you can decide how many of them are at the table at any one time, and can have those who are out of money leave and be replaced with other people coming in.

We provide a [sample game in the appendix](../appendix/appendix-dice-games.md) if you need some inspiration for something to simulate with.
