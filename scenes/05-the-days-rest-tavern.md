# The Day's Rest Tavern

The party trails Groubun from the Docks, suspicious of where he is heading.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces Fordem, Hope, and Whiskers.
- Provides further opportunities for throwing suspicion on Groubun.
- A chance for social investigation.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have their suspicions of Groubun confirmed. Or at least suspect that Groubun is engaging in some kind of illicit business at the tavern.
- Have had a chance to meet Whiskers, and talk to Hope (and potentially Fordem) about the tavern.
- Have had an opportunity to look around the Day's Rest Tavern.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Hope can be engaged in friendly conversation to learn about her backstory, but also information she knows about the tavern.
  - She will mention the sale and that she remembers the old owner if asked.
  - She knows that the old owner sold in a hurry, since he was apparently paying off a debt. (This was of course, coercion on Fordem and the Piranhas' part).
- Fordem will also share information about the tavern, but be less forthcoming with his information than Hope.
  - He will not rent a room to the party, claiming they are fully booked tonight.
  - He will give his (public-facing) origin story for finding Whiskers, but this will be at odds with how Whiskers seems to behave towards him. Fordem's barkeeper act will play into this, saying Whiskers seems to prefer Hope despite Fordem taking him in.
- If the draft diagram for the Confining Collar was found in the Ordo Magicae, the party may recognise it on Whiskers.
- Interacting with Whiskers may lead an observant character to suspect he's no ordinary cat.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Day's Rest Tavern

As the party follows Groubun on his journey through the streets from the docks, it will quickly become apparent that he is not heading to the temple (the only plausible location if he previously gave his "healing salve" excuse).
He will lead the party to the Day's Rest tavern.

When they arrive, the tavern will be busy and noisy.
There will be a bouncer on the door and the sound of music and chatter coming from inside the tavern.
Groubun will be waved in by the bouncer when he arrives, the party will have to give up their weapons before they enter.

The tavern itself sits on one corner of a 4-way junction.
It is a large, 2-story structure which is attached on one side to what looks to be terraced houses along one of the streets leading up to the junction.
There is a narrow alleyway that runs from the street along the tavern wall, which a window in the tavern's kitchen opens out into.

The door to the tavern opens out into a large hall or common room.
There is a hearth on one of the walls with a fire going, and the bar backs onto the wall on the right of the doorway upon entering.
Along from the bar (moving away from the entryway) is the door to the kitchen, and along the same wall in the opposite direction is a small doorway that leads to a staircase and the owner's room.

The area opposite the bar has little floor space, mostly being taken up by tables of varying sizes.
A staircase leads to a mezzanine level that overlooks the table area and bar, where some more seating can be found and a band / musician can be found playing.
The upper level also leads to the restroom and the rooms for rent.

It's the end of a working day and the tavern is busy.
Most tables are full with patrons, with most of them being from the working classes of Halfyord.
There is some seating at the bar - Groubun will be at one stool, talking to Fordem who will be pretending to serve.
The mezzanine level will have a live band playing, whilst on the main floor Hope will be serving drinks and food, or preparing such in the kitchen.
Whiskers will be walking around in his usual plight, but will start in the kitchen until he realises Fordem and Groubun are present.

## Arriving at the Tavern

There will be a bouncer at the door who will insist on taking the party's weapons before they enter.
Mention that there looks to be a fairly secure cabinet located just to the side of the entrance that already houses weapons of varying degrees of care and sophistication, to ease the party's worries.
The bouncer will also take obvious magical foci; such as staffs, crystal balls, wands etc off the party members too.
He will not take away magical foci that are not used by Wizards - such as druidic foci used by rangers or druids, an artificer's tools, or the holy symbol of a paladin or cleric (unless this is attached to a weapon or shield, of course).
If one member of the party has their magical focus taken away, and another does not, have each character in the party roll either an insight or arcana check:

- (Insight DC 12) When asking for the party's weapons, the bouncer did not ask for the magical foci with the same fluency or professionalism, almost like he was having to remember what to list off or isn't familiar with these items.
  - 17+: The character clocks that the magical foci not confiscated are the those that are typically used by Wizards or Artificers.
- (Arcana DC 12) The character clocks that the magical foci not confiscated are the those that are typically used by Wizards or Artificers.
  - 17+: The character also clocks that the way the magical foci were listed was very illogical, as if the bouncer was trying to remember all the items on a list but had to skip over some entries and fill in the gaps later.

The bouncer will not let the party into the tavern without them surrendering their weapons and foci.
They can of course attempt to smuggle weapons or foci into the tavern, or they can attempt to convince the bouncer they should be allowed to take "holdout" weapons (such as daggers or small clubs) in for self-defence reasons.

- (Stealth DC 16) To smuggle a small concealed weapon, such as a dagger, light hammer, etc, in without the bouncer noticing.
  - Increase the DC of this check for more obvious weapon-smuggling attempts.
- (Persuasion DC 17) The bouncer can be convinced to let the party take holdout weapons into the tavern, but will still insist on taking their other weapons and foci.

Once inside the tavern, the party have several options.
Have them all make a perception check as they enter the tavern:

- (Perception DC 8) A character can notice Groubun at the bar, talking to the bartender (Fordem).
  - 10+: If they stay standing in the doorway for a while, they might draw the attention of the patrons - in particular Groubun - which may be detrimental to the party's objectives. They may want to find somewhere to sit.
  - 12+: There is a game of cards being played out on one of the tables in the common area. It seems that a round has just finished and several of the players are leaving the table, opening up space for new players to sit.
  - 14+: There looks to be a small ring of chalk on the floor in one corner of the common area, where there is a small crowd and a bookie. Two people who look like tavern brawlers look like they are participating in fisticuffs.
  - 16+: There is a small table of patrons who look like they have been at the end of the their drinks for a while, and will be leaving a free table soon.
  - 17+: Music can be heard from the upper mezzanine level, and there looks to be a fairly large crowd up there enjoying the performance.

The party will of course still be in the tavern entryway at this point, and if they dawdle for too long there Fordem, Groubun, Hope, or a patron of the tavern will draw attention to them for just standing around in the entryway and blocking the door.
Depending on how the check above went, the party might attempt to blend in by joining the game of cards going on at one table, or to head up to the mezzanine level to "enjoy" the music, or attempting to secure the soon-to-be-empty table.
Specific party members may also have other means of blending in (a bard might try to join the band playing, for example).
Wherever the party decides to blend in, have them roll a group stealth check (DC 10) to avoid Groubun's attention.

If the party elects to confront Groubun, he will claim to be visiting Fordem (on his way to the temple, if the bottles are questioned).
Fordem will come across to "save" him a short way into this conversation, and attempt to lead him into the kitchen to later get him into the cellar. Interacting directly with Groubun in any way causes him to gain a suspicion point.
He also gains this suspicion point if he becomes aware of the party's presence in the tavern (and this stacks with the point he may have acquired from noticing the party tailing him).

From here, there are several events that can happen.
It is a good idea to alternate resolving "serious" / "plot relevant" events with "role-playing" / flavourful events to give some idea of the passage of time or activities.
You can even have the role-playing events give benefits or hindrances to the other events, depending on how the party acts in each.

The plot relevant ("PR") events are:

FIXME these ToCs auto-format!!

- [Meeting Whiskers](#meeting-whiskers).
- [Groubun's Visit](#groubuns-visit).
- [Poking Around](#poking-around).
- [Don't tread on the fish](#dont-tread-on-the-fish).

whilst the role-playing ("RP") events are:

- [A Game of Cards?](#a-game-of-cards)
- [Fighting Ring](#fighting-ring)

## Meeting Whiskers

If the party seats themselves and watches Groubun, after a short while Whiskers will jump onto the bar and start his usual hissing and bottle pushing at the people who imprisoned him.
This activity can also be used as an escape for Groubun if a character has decided to confront him.
Fordem will attempt to grab Whiskers to stop him from causing more damage (mimic a check to grab the cat) but Whiskers will be too quick and jump onto the tavern floor.
Fordem will shout for Hope, who will either by in the kitchen or serving drinks, to get the cat under control and lead Groubun away from the bar.

- (Athletics) (Sleight of Hand) (CONTESTED: Whiskers' acrobatics (+3)) A character can meander through the busy tavern to catch Whiskers before Hope does.

If no-one from the party manages or tries to catch Whiskers, Hope will try to catch him and will be successful after a minute or two.
Local patrons will laugh, and if Whiskers stops on a table they will try to pet him.
If the party didn't try to catch Whiskers, have him run to wherever the party has based themselves, so Hope can catch up to him there.

- (Athletics) (Sleight of Hand) (CONTESTED: Whiskers' acrobatics (+3)) The party manages to protect their drinks from the marauding cat.

Hope will apologise to the party when she catches up to Whiskers, which offers an opportunity for the party to ask her about where the cat came from and the history of the tavern.
She'll remark that he's still getting used to his new home, and so is she to being a pet owner.
Hope is genuinely unaware of Whiskers' true identity.
The party might ask for more information, which she'll happily provide:

- Hope found "Whiskers" out inside the tavern one day - Fordem emerged from the cellar looking for him and Hope persuaded Fordem to keep him as the tavern cat.
  - The reality is that Whiskers had escaped his cage inside the hideout and was making a break for it, but was inadvertently stopped by Hope after Fordem gave chase.
  - Fordem didn't have a good excuse for not keeping the cat, since he cound't throw Whiskers out given he was supposed to be their prisoner, but couldn't just take him down into the cellar without an explanation.
- Since then, he's taken a liking to Hope but has refused to get along with Fordem.
  - If asked about the collar, Hope will mention that Fordem had his friend from the "magic shop" make it. Fordem said it keeps Whiskers near the tavern at all times.
  - If asked about who made the collar, Hope will happily point out Groubun at the bar (if he's still there) and say it was his work.

If the party's drinks were spilled, Hope will use prestidigitation to clean the table and party member's clothes, if necessary.
After the conversation peters out, Hope will leave to get back to her job and make a remark that Whiskers seems settled now.
The party can continue to interact with Whiskers, but the Confining collar will prevent any beneficial spell-casting.

- (Arcana DC 10) (Only if Hope cast a spell) Hope's casting of prestidigitation is innate, which makes sense because she is a tiefling.
  - 12+: (Only if the party has inferred the gang relies on potions and is not inherently full of magically gifted members) This is not like the potion use that was observed at the market, where the perpetrators relied on items and potions to grant magical abilities.

Whiskers will take a liking to any members of the party that display magical talents or magical equipment, in particular the character who is wearing Jenessa's ring (if any).
Attempting to pet Whiskers will see him try to avoid this and move away (he's still a prickly elven wizard underneath the cat skin!) and he likewise will not eat any of the cat feed that Hope will offer to the party to give to him.
He will eat "human food" if a party member attempts to feed him that.

Through interacting with Whiskers, the party might notice:

- The [Confining Collar](../appendix/appendix-custom-items.md#confining-collar) he is wearing.
  - (Arcana DC 15) (ADV: The design was noted in the Ordo) To identify it as being similar if not identical to the design Groubun had in the lab.
- During the conversation with either Hope, or after Hope has left Whiskers with the party at their table / seats and the party talks amongst themselves:
  - (Animal Handling DC 12) Whiskers' movements seem to be slightly janky for a cat, if such a thing is possible. He's agile, but doesn't seem to settle on the table like a normal cat does for example. Over time, a character might notice he doesn't groom himself either.
  - (Animal Handling DC 14) (Insight 17) Whiskers moves his head to follow the conversation at the table, rather than being ambivalent.
- If attempting to cast a spell on Whiskers unsuccessfully - the collar's runes appear to glow, then fade as the magic dissipates. Whiskers will react excitedly, almost hopeful.
  - (Arcana DC 15) (Auto: Identify spell) The collar appears to do more than what Hope has said it does, appearing to shield Whiskers from most external magic sources. This check and the identify spell do not reveal the full extent of the enchantment however, due to the nature of said enchantment itself.
- Whiskers also understands common, but is obviously unable to communicate in it back to the party.
  - He can respond with yes / no answers via some combination of winking, paw pats, tail waggling, etc, but only if the party picks up on his odd behaviour and asks these questions of him.

## Groubun's Visit

Groubun will be at the bar when the party enters the tavern, already talking to Fordem.
They are waiting for an opportunity to head into the cellar so Groubun can drop his bag of potions off.

Interacting directly with Groubun awards him a suspicion point and triggers the encounter in [don't tread on the fish](#dont-tread-on-the-fish).

- His excuse for not being at the temple will be weak at this point, but he'll say that he feels Jenessa judges him for how often he goes out drinking each evening and so covers up where he's going from time to time.
- Directly grilling Groubun in this way gives another suspicion point *on top of* the one gained from just talking to him initially.

If instead a character plays the part of a rude patron and hails for Fordem's attention whilst he's conversing with Groubun, Fordem will respond cordially and ask for a moment.
If the character persists, he will call for Hope to see to the patron.
The DM can also introduce Whiskers at this point as a means of freeing up Fordem and Groubun.

Whilst the party interacts with Hope and Whiskers, Groubun will be smuggled into the hideout via the kitchen by Fordem.

- (Perception DC 19) (DIS: Character is distracted by Whiskers or Hope) The character notices Fordem letting Groubun into the kitchen, with his satchel bag. Fordem then returns to the bar.

If a player was actively looking or watching Groubun from another location in the tavern:

- (Stealth DC 20) (Perception DC 15) (DIS: The character has directly interacted with Groubun or Fordem) Fordem seems to glance around the tavern, before indicating to Groubun to head into the kitchen.

Regardless if the party sees Groubun slip away, Fordem will claim he dropped off part of his tab he'd promised to repay, stopped for a short conversation, then headed off.
Fordem will provide a generic excuse that doesn't match Groubun's "temple delivery" excuse from earlier in the day; something along the lines of "Groubun headed back, said he had some magic script to work on or something" or to that effect.

If the party stays at the tavern for another hour, they can repeat the perception check from before to notice Groubun slipping out of the cellar and the tavern.
He will be heading back to the Ordo to sleep if the party elects to follow him again.

## Poking Around

Beyond the social interactions available in the large common area, there are a few other pieces of information that can be found by searching the off-limits areas of the tavern.

Amongst other consequences, the party getting caught will trigger the encounter in [Don't Tread on the Fish](#dont-tread-on-the-fish).

### Guest Rooms

The bathrooms to the tavern are located on the upper level, just before the corridor that leads to the guest bedrooms.
Hope's room is the furthest room from the bathrooms, and the rest are rented out to guests - though they are currently all being using by gang members in preparation for the heist tomorrow.
The corridor to the guest rooms is unguarded and public, though characters will get suspicious of someone walking along or loitering in the corridor if they notice such behaviour.

Breaking into any of the guest bedrooms requires either appropriate tools to pick the lock, or the key.

- (Sleight of Hand / Thieves' Tools DC 13) Pick the lock to a guest room.

Fordem has a master key on his person, and the bouncer (at the tavern entrance) and the gang-member [ring fighters](#fighting-ring) and book-keeper are also Piranhas members who have a key to their respective rooms.

Unless events in the common area transpire that way, none of the guests (gang members) will be in their rooms to be on the receiving end of an unexpected interruption.
The rooms don't have any explicit clues, but there is some circumstantial evidence that may contradict Fordem's assertion that the tavern is sold out tonight:

- (Investigation DC 12) Examining a guest room for a few minutes reveals that it looks like the occupant is travelling without any baggage. The wardrobes / chest of draws are empty, as there are no books / bags etc placed in the room.

Hope's room is at the far end of the corridor.
Only Hope and Fordem (via his master key) have a key to the lock, but it can also be broken into with suitable tools:

- (Sleight of Hand / Thieves' Tools DC 15) To pick the lock to Hope's room.

Hope's room is a contrast to the guest rooms, since she lives there.
The wardrobe contains spare work attire, plus more casual outfits and a slightly more elegant looking outfit that serves as Hope's formal attire.
There are books, letters, and other personal belongings scattered throughout the room too.
A desk in the corner has some opened letters on it, and a locked drawer that contains Hope's savings.

- (Investigation DC 10) Examining the desk will draw a character to a letter that Hope received around 6 months. It appears to be correspondence with an acquaintance.
  - This is a letter from the Day's Rest's previous owner, who Hope has been in sporadic contact with since they sold the tavern. It will talk about how they're back on their feet and have partnered with a landlord in another city to open a new tavern. From the general tone of the letter, it sounds like the writer was in financial trouble and has only just started to climb out of it.
  - 17+: A character notices the locked draw of the desk.
  - (Sleight of Hand / Thieves' Tools DC 18) (AUTO: Hope's Key) To pick the lock to the locked draw.
    - In the draw will be 2d10 GP, some of which will be in silvers. There will also be a small piece of parchment written by Hope that just says "savings goals" and has a small list of things that Hope is saving up for; a trip / holiday to a nearby city, jewellery or other accessories, etc. It also contains memos reminding her to ask Fordem for time off.

### Fordem's Room

At the intersection of the wall that hosts the tavern door and wall that the bar backs onto is a staircase (containing utility items like brooms, cleaning supplies, rat poison, etc) that leads to a 2nd-level room that was designed to house the tavern owner.
Fordem sleeps in this upper room, and uses the room as his office when keeping up his tavern owner front, but uses the hideout to store most of his possessions.

The door to the stairwell is also marked with a "staff only" sign, but is not itself locked.
The bouncer, as well as Fordem and Hope, will chastise characters they catch attempting to access the area, and may throw them out of the tavern.
If Groubun is still at the bar when a character is noticed attempting this, he gains a point of suspicion if he hasn't already gained one this scene.

The door to Fordem's room is naturally locked.
Only Fordem's key will work on the door to his room, but there is a small window that opens onto the same alleyway that the kitchen shares a window with.

- (Sleight of Hand / Thieves' Tools DC 19) To pick the lock to Fordem's room.
- (Acrobatics / Athletics DC 15) (Adv: suitable climbing aid) To scale the alley wall using a nearby drainpipe and the loose stones in the wall and reach the open window to Fordem's room.

Fordem's room is essentially the upper-class equivalent to the guest rooms - it contains a double bed, large wardrobe, desk big enough to work from, shelves and a small armchair with a side table.
A large rug covers the wooden floor in the centre of the room.

- (Investigation DC 10) To deduce the same conclusions as can be drawn from the guest rooms. Fordem's room does not look lived in, the wardrobe is barely half full and the desk is almost too organised to be a site of active use. No trinkets nor personal belongings appear to be in the room. The bedsheets are not made, implying they're slept in though.
  - 14+ (explicitly examining the desk): A character can ruffle through a stack of papers and find the bill of sale. It looks like the tavern was purchased for an incredibly low price.
    - 16+: The sale process was also completed in a very short time.
    - (History DC 10): The sale was completed shortly (~3 months) after Kamonas and Shufharz were appointed to Halfyord.
      - 15+ (only if the party has asked Shufharz / Kamonas about how they got rid of the Piranhas the first time): The magistrate who appears on the bill of sale is one of the officials that was removed as part of the wider corruption investigation, that started Shufharz' efforts to dislodge the Piranhas.
  - 20+: There is a loose floorboard that can be felt under the rug. Removing the rug and then the floorboard reveals a spare master key (akin to what Fordem carries) to the tavern.

If Fordem's key was obtained by pickpocketing or otherwise getting him to part with it, allow the party to investigate his room before Fordem realises the key is missing, and goes to check if he left it in his room.
This will obviously require the party to rapidly evacuate, or hide in, the room.
Leaving the stolen key in an obvious place in the room (like on the desk) will have Fordem retrieve it and return to the bar without much investigation, **locking the room behind him**.
Placing the key from under the floorboards here, and covering up the fact the rug has been moved, can be used to achieve the same effect.

If Fordem cannot find the key in an obvious place, he will attempt to retrieve the spare master key, muttering to himself (as far as he is aware) about becoming forgetful.
He will then leave and lock the room as if he had retrieved the key from the desk.
If the spare key is missing, or tampering is obvious, have Fordem leave the room immediately.
He will return to the bar, ask Hope for her spare key to the cellar (citing his own age and forgetfulness as a "joke" that he's forgotten where he put his key) and enter the cellar (and hideout), locking the cellar door behind him.
If Groubun is still at the bar, Fordem will (discretely) take him into the cellar too.
Groubun gains 4 suspicion points (Fordem knows that someone is poking around the tavern) but there are no other notable impacts on the story.
Fordem will retrieve a spare key from the hideout to use for the rest of the adventure.

### Kitchen

The kitchen is staff only, but the doors are left ajar and patrons frequently go up to the kitchen to get Hope's attention to ask for small plates of food, or to ask about the beverages on tap.
A character who has a suitable opportunity to look inside the kitchen may discover that Whisker's food bowl is full - he has not eaten anything.
His water bowl is likewise almost full.

The kitchen window will be on the latch, and backs onto the alleyway that runs down the side of the tavern.
There is puddle of water and grease beneath the window, where it looks like kitchen pots are emptied.

### Cellar

The cellar is locked and is not meant to be accessed by the party until after the heist tomorrow.
However, if the party obtains the master key there is nothing to stop them from accessing the hideout early.

All staff at the tavern will of course attempt to apprehend the party if they are seen accessing the cellar (Hope will alert Fordem after giving a warning), which will result in (best case) the party being thrown out of the tavern and the key retrieved.
The local patrons will perceive the party as being in the wrong of course, and may run onto the street to get help.

If the cellar is successfully accessed, the party can proceed straight to [Hideout Infiltration](./07-infiltrating-the-hideout.md) as if they'd entered via the cellar.
Notable differences will be that:

- Whiskers will not join the party (unless they actively bring him along),
- Groubun will be present for the confrontation in Carlton's room. He will side with Fordem and Carlton regardless.
- Carlton will not offer parley.
- For additional challenge, you may want to add some Piranhas gang members to the recreation room of the hideout, to represent those members who will be joining the heist the following day.

## A Game of Cards?

Joining the table with the card game going offers the opportunity for some gambling.
If you have a means of simulating a dice game, then feel free to use this here.
The other players - patrons of the tavern - each only have around 5 SP to play with (total, for the entire playing session).
But you can decide how many of them are at the table at any one time, and can have those who are out of money leave and be replaced with other people coming in.

We provide a [sample game in the appendix](../appendix/appendix-dice-games.md) if you need some inspiration for something to simulate with.

## Fighting Ring

In one corner of the common area will be a small fighting ring with a book-keeper and what looks to be a few combatants.
The majority of the fighters are gang members, but some are just burlier dock workers or locals from the neighbourhood.

- (Perception DC 20) A character notices the gang necklace hanging from the book-keeper's neck.

If approached, the book-keeper will explain that the fights are semi-recreational.
Combat is non-lethal, no weapons or magic, and lasts until blood is drawn on one side or a combatant yields the contest.
Anyone can enter as a fighter, and spectators tend to place bets on the victor - he will point out a chalkboard which appears to have a few names on it along with some odds.
Fighters receive a payout for winning, proportional to the total amount that was bet on the fight.
Newcomers are wildcards, so the book-keeper will only be willing to offer 5 SP for a character volunteering to fight.

- (Persuasion DC 15) To haggle for an increased rate. Give 1 additional SP equal to the check total minus 15. Getting 15 exactly will have the book-keeper increase the rate to 6 SP for the second fight the character takes part in.

Characters can sign up for further bouts, so long as they continue to be successful.
Over time, the spectators will start to back a successful fighter over some of the regulars.
If multiple player characters want to get involved, have the book-keeper explain that team bouts are also supported, with the same rules.

### Terms of Engagement

The rules for a single fight in the ring are as follows:

- No weapons or magic allowed. Only unarmed strikes (punches, kicks, headbutts, etc) are permitted.
  - Characters that have features that improve their unarmed strikes still benefit from these features during the fight, if they are eligible.
- Armour has to be removed prior to engaging. Most fighters will also remove loose clothing like shirts to better enable freedom of movement.
  - (Perception DC 12) (Participating in a fighting vs a gang member) The character's opponent has removed their shirt, exposing a silver necklace that Piranha's gangs carry.
- A character's armour class for the fight is equal to **5** plus either their constitution or dexterity modifier (character's choice).
  - Characters with the "unarmoured defence" class or species traits may continue to use these features to calculate their armour class if they still qualify for them.
- A character's hit points total for the fight is equal to either their constitution or dexterity score. A player decides which to use at the start of a fight and may not change their decision during the fight.
  - Constitution represents a fighting style that relies on taking hits in a sensible / hardy way without drawing blood.
  - Dexterity represents a more graceful fighting style of parrying or dodging the opponent's attacks.

Combatants then roll initiative and fight 1-on-1 as per the usual combat rules, with the character being reduced to 0 "hit points" being the one to draw blood first.
A character can of course concede the contest on their turn, or attempt to persuade their opponent into doing so.
For every round of combat that passes, both combatants gain progressive +1 bonuses to their attack rolls, representing the fatigue of fighting in close quarters (and mechanically, to speed up the combat!).

Team fights use the same rules, save that all members of one team must yield or draw blood before one team claims victory.
Team members that draw blood or yield are removed from the fight when they do (potentially introducing a numbers advantages).

Violating any of the above rules, or cheating / interfering with a fight, causes an instant loss and has repercussions (the offenders may be thrown out of the tavern, the book-keeper might demand a fee, etc).

### Rewards

A successful fighter earns their fee as negotiated with the book-keeper.

Party members that bet on fights and won get double their original bet back (maximum payout of 5 GP).
If a party member bet on another party member (IE on a newcomer fighter) who won, they win back 1.5 times their original bet.

There is also the opportunity to notice the Piranhas members that are participating.

If the book-keeper looses more than 5 GP in payouts to either a newcomer fighter or a character betting on the newcomer, [don't tread on the fish](#dont-tread-on-the-fish) will trigger.

### Potential Opponents

When starting a fight, roll a d20 and consult the list below for the opponent's (relevant) stats:

- 1: Total HP: 4, +0 to hit, AC 5.
- 2-7: Total HP: 10, +2 to hit, AC 8.
- 8-15: Total HP: 13, +2 to hit, AC 10.
- 15+: Total HP: 17, +3 to hit, AC 11.

On a roll of 5+, the opponent is a Piranhas gang member in plain clothes.

## Don't Tread on the Fish

When the party decides it's time to leave, they may be tailed by a small gang contingent in response to their activities in the tavern.
Planned ways in which this can happen are if:

- The party wins a significant amount of money from the fighting ring, at the book-keeper's expense.
- Groubun becomes suitably suspicious.
- The party is caught whilst poking around the tavern.

After the party leaves the tavern and travels a reasonable distance, have them walk down a dimly lit street.
On their tail will be one Piranhas gang member for each member of the party - these gang members will be split into two groups.
The first group will move in front of the party to cut them off, whilst the other approaches from behind.

- (Perception DC 17): For a character in the party to notice the gang members before they complete the encirclement.

If the party notices their tail, they can actively choose to stick to brighter streets or attempt to shake the gang members before they make it back to the barracks.
The gang members trailing them will not take any further action if they party reaches the barracks safely, and will return to the tavern.

If the party does not notice the tail, have them roll one more perception check to avoid being surprised.

- (Perception DC 12) (ADV: suitable criminal or investigative background feature) A character notices the approaching gang members in front of them, and glances behind in time to notice the other group bringing up the rear. This character is not surprised when combat begins.

### Encounter Information

Trigger: The gang completes it's encirclement.
Intended difficulty: Easy

Participants based on party size:

| Party size | Piranhas Gang Member |
|:-:|:-:|
| X | =X |

Enemy Objectives:

If the trigger for this event was the book-keeper loosing money, the gang members are planning a mugging.

Otherwise, this is a hit job, with the objective of at least putting the party out of action for a considerable amount of time (though not necessarily lethally).

### Initial Locations

Half (rounded up) of the gang member start in a rough line between 10-15 feet directly in front of the party.

The other half (rounded down) start behind the party at a slightly similar distance.

The party should be walking as a group along the street as they would any other day.
Exceptions can be made if the party was aware of their tail and decided to deliberately draw the gang members out.

### Other Encounter Factors

The tailing gang members will have face coverings, and will not have their crossbows.

### Loot

- Silver piranhas necklace from any killed or captured gang members.
- (If the book-keeper sent the gang members) One of the gang members will be recognised as one of the fighters from the ring (if their face covering is removed).

### Notes

It is possible for the party to capture (at least one) gang member from this encounter, which may prompt interrogation.
In order to keep the story consistent, these gang members:

- Are staying in the guest rooms in the tavern.
- Were sent by the book-keeper (if the fighting ring was the reason for triggering the event) or the bouncer (if another reason triggered the event). Both these characters will deny any involvement as slander if the party goes back to confront them.
- They do not know where the hideout is (they will claim that they're blinded when they meet a contact who lets them in).
  - They will reveal that they can access the hideout via the sewers, but it is one-way and only open at scheduled times (after planned heists).
  - They will also reveal that their rooms at the tavern were arranged by the gang.

The gang members, of course, must be persuaded or intimidated into giving up this information.

## Next Scenes

The party should return to Shufharz at the barracks, to plan for the following day.
