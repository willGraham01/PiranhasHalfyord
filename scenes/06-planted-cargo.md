# The Planted Cargo

After completing their investigations for the evening, the party returns to the barracks for rest and to plan the following day with Shufharz.
This scene covers the execution of Shufharz' plan to lure out the Piranhas gang and track them to their headquarters.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the main plot hook for the party to track the Piranhas to their hideout.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have successfully tracked either the gang or a piece of animated loot to the hideout in The Day's Rest.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Though indirectly, the party can learn that more gang members have been sent than they might have planned. This is an indicator that Groubun is suspicious.

## Setting

The [planning stage](#the-night-before-planning) takes place in the barracks, either in Shufharz' "war room" or in Kamonas' office with the governor present.
The party will be offered bed and board here for the evening.

The next day, the scene takes place at the docks, during the day rather than the evening.
The dockyard will be busy with workers, merchants moving their goods, and civilian traffic walking along the waterway.
Shufharz will have deliberately lowered the guard presence at the relevant docking station (moving them to the market as if in response to the attack yesterday).

Piranhas gang members will have already taken up some of their disguises when the party arrives at the docks, whilst others will simply be lying in wait.
If more gang members have been sent due to Groubun's suspicion levels, they will be present on the bridge in "over-watch".

## The Night Before: Planning

When the party returns after their foray to the Day's Rest Tavern (or with Shufharz if they failed to follow along from the docks itself), Shufharz will go over the plan and confirm what everyone is doing.
She will confirm that:

- The harbourmaster and captain are in on the plan.
- The "merchant" whose cart is being loaded up (with the goods from the ship) is a plain-clothes guard that she trusts.

Everyone else at the docks is in the dark about the scheme.
She and the detachment of guards that would normally be posted to the docking station will be patrolling the market, to give the Piranhas the impression that they are fearful of another attack in the market.
Shufharz will also remind the party that the objective is to track the Piranhas' to their hideout and arrest / "handle" their leadership, so it may be prudent to not interfere too much.

The party is free to impart any information to Shufharz that they obtained during the evening.
Shufharz won't want to make a move on Groubun (even if she is convinced by evidence the party presents) in fear of dissuading the Piranhas' attack tomorrow, though she may agree to send some guards to keep watch on the Ordo outpost.

Have the party confirm the positions that they want to take during the day tomorrow.
Shufharz has spare clothes to allow party members to dress like members of the town guard, dockworkers, or sailors (the latter can arrive on the ship by getting up early in the morning and walking upstream to meet it before it "sets off" for the town).
This is predominantly an opportunity for the party to plan for the following day, using their reconossence.
Once everyone's roles are set, allow the party to take a long rest (by staying in the barracks for the evening) before jumping time forward to the [next morning](#the-day-of-the-heist).

## The Day of the Heist

The following day will see the docks in it's usual busy state.
When the party arrives;

- There will be many dock workers present and going about their business, along with the harbourmaster organising a small group of dock-hands in preparation for the upcoming arrival.
- Another group of dock workers, along with a Foreman, will be setting up the docking crane.
- An undercover guard (posing as a merchant with a cart) will be waiting near where the road meets the docking station, expecting the delivery to be unloaded.

The exact number of dock workers and other passive NPCs is up to DM choice.
When the action kicks off, it is recommended to track at least one civilian NPC from each group of dockworkers, as well as the Foreman, as they try to escape or control the chaos.
The rest can be described as fleeing using descriptive flavour.

The gang members will have already gotten into position by the time the party arrives.
Characters that actively look out for suspicious behaviour may notice some things being out of place.
Give the player characters the opportunity to take their places and any investigative actions before the ship docks.
If the party is taking too long, the arrival of the ship can also be used to speed up or limit their preparations.

The gang members will not turn hostile (unless they really have to) until the ship has arrived.
If a character forces their hand in some way, they will use the potions of animating on nearby barrels and debris and attempt to escape.
The other gang members present on the docks will attempt to assist (likely by throwing down their own animating potions on the barrels) and then escape themselves.
In this case, the party will be forced to either capture a gang member who is present and interrogate them in order to learn the location of the hideout.
If any gang members escape, they will alert everyone in the hideout and the party will face much tougher resistance when they arrive.

Failing to capture a gang member, or otherwise learn the location of the hideout in the above circumstance, results in the party failing the adventure if they cannot track Carlton down by the end of the day.
The Piranhas successfully move the stash in their vault out of Halfyord, and plant their evidence on Faire (TSTK see possible endings FIXME).

### Gang Members Disguised as Dock workers

If the dockworker's clothes were left in the bridge stash, or weren't discovered, then two gang members will have already retrieved these disguises and taken their positions.

There will be (at least) one gang member at the docking crane, posing as a worker. The Foreman will be giving them instructions along with the rest of the group.

- (Perception DC 16) (Insight DC 14) (ADV: The dockworkers clothes were discovered in the stash) To notice one of the dock workers appears to not really know what they're meant to be doing, or appears to be new. They're essentially repeating menial tasks to make themselves look busy, but aren't actually contributing to the work.

There will be another gang member getting changed inside the warehouse.

- (Perception DC 15) To notice a dockworker leaving the warehouse, seeming to look around for a second as if not sure where to go, then join the group that the Harbourmaster is addressing.

If the dockworker's clothes were removed from the stash however, these gang members will be improvising.

- (Perception DC 25) (AUTO: See Invisibility / Detect Magic) To notice the gang member that would have been at the docking crane, now lying (invisibly) in wait near a stack of barrels next to the crane.

The other gang member will be inside the warehouse, having just ambushed and knocked a genuine dock worker, and taken their outer clothes as a disguise.
The Foreman will have sent one dockworker into the warehouse to gather some tools.
This dockworker will now be unconscious (but stable), and hidden in one of the empty tarpaulin boxes.

- (Perception DC 10) To overhear the Foreman audibly saying phrases like "has anyone seen X" (where X is a suitable name for a dockworker), "has X got those tools yet?" etc.
  - If a character dressed as a dockworker approaches the crane, the Foreman will ask them one of these questions, and send them to "see what's taking X so long".
  - Approaching the warehouse will coincide with a gang member (now wearing dockworker's clothes) leave the warehouse:
    - (Perception DC 13) The dockworker's clothes don't seem to be a particularly good fit for them.
      - 16+: This person is not carrying any tools.
    - Asking the dockworker (gang member) whether they've seen X will have them say they don't know who that is, and move to join the harbourmaster's group.
  - Investigating the warehouse will offer more insights:
    - (Investigation DC 12) (ADV: the warehouse was investigated during the night) The tool station is disturbed.
      - 14+: To notice an empty bottle on the tool station, that contains the remnants of some kind of potion.
        - (Arcana DC 13) This is the remnants of a [potion of lesser invisibility](../items/potion-of-lesser-invisibility.md).
      - 15+: To notice some scuff marks on the floor near the tool station, which lead to one of the crates covered by a tarpaulin.
      - Removing the tarpaulin and opening the crate will reveal the unconscious dockworker. They can be bought to conciousness if the character has the means, but will be unable to describe what happened. The gang member caught them by surprise from behind.

### Gang Members at the Underpass

A group of gang members will also be present at the bridge underpass, and doing a relatively poor job of disguising themselves as fishermen.
They will have different reactions to other characters approaching the group.
Again, what happens here depends on what the party did (if anything) with the hidden stash.

If the potions in the stash were removed, a character looking into the underpass will notice two "fishermen" facing the water, and another fisherman seemingly scraping at the underpass arch.
The fishermen will not be paying any particular attention to the river, and there is only a single fishing rod set up by the looks of things.

- (Nature DC 10 / Survival DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the illusion in the water) There are also seemingly no fishing supplies (nets, bait bags, etc) in the immediate area.
- (Perception DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the stash)
  - 13+: The fisherman near the wall has the reflective tooth from the water his hands, and looks confused.
  - This is because the potions are not present.
  - 16+: The character can hear the gang members talking (in Thieves's Cant) about the lack of supplies.
    - A character that is able to decipher Thieves's Cant will learn that they did bring separate [potions of animating](../items/potion-of-animating.md).

If the potions in the stash were left there (or not discovered), a character looking into the underpass will notice the "fishermen" standing in a group, handing out bottles between them.

- (Nature DC 10 / Survival DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the illusion in the water) There are also seemingly no fishing supplies (nets, bait bags, etc) in the immediate area.
  - 15+: The bottles being passed out are nothing like what someone would use to store bait.
- (Perception DC 13) The bottles being passed out are nothing like what someone would use to store bait.
- (Arcana DC 17) The bottles being passed out look like they contain volatile, potion-like substances.

Approaching the fishermen will garner different reactions from them, based on how the character(s) look.
The gang members will - in all cases - keep up their "fishermen" ruse, unless they are pressed by the character that approaches, or the character actively hangs around the area.

- (Intimidation / Persuasion DC 16) (AUTO: Character is dressed as a guard) A character can attempt to convince the gang members to "move on".
  - The gang members will not attempt to argue with a guard.
  - A suitable bribe may also get the gang members to relocate.
  - The gang members will leave towards the civilian docks, and they will relocate to the top of the bridge in time for the ship's arrival. They will be forced to throw their potions from the bridge when animating the goods or barrels, reducing their accuracy.

If a character loiters around the underpass, when the gang kicks off it's attack, one of the "fishermen" will attempt to restrain them (or throw them in the river Hal) whilst the others begin the attack.

## The Ship's Arrival

The arrival of the ship and it's subsequent docking "triggers" the gang's attack and the combat encounter.
As the ship docks, the ship's captain will disembark to engage the harbourmaster in conversation, and the guard disguised as a merchant will move to join them and direct where they want the goods placed.
The crane will begin to move towards the ship to start unloading the heavier cargo, whilst the sailors will team up with the harbourmaster's group of dock workers to unload the cargo.

The gang members will then attack simultaneously.
If a character is aware of any of the gang members lying in wait, roll initiative to see if they get a chance to act before the gang members do.
Otherwise, the gang members will immediately:

- FIXME TO HERE

After this, if initiative was not rolled before, enter combat now.
