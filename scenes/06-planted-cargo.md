# The Planted Cargo

After completing their investigations for the evening, the party returns to the barracks for rest and to plan the following day with Shufharz.
This scene covers the execution of Shufharz' plan to lure out the Piranhas gang and track them to their headquarters.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the main plot hook for the party to track the Piranhas to their hideout.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have successfully tracked either the gang or a piece of animated loot to the hideout in The Day's Rest.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Though indirectly, the party can learn that more gang members have been sent than they might have planned. This is an indicator that Groubun is suspicious.

## Setting

The [planning stage](#the-night-before-planning) takes place in the barracks, either in Shufharz' "war room" or in Kamonas' office with the governor present.
The party will be offered bed and board here for the evening.

The next day, the scene takes place at the docks, during the day rather than the evening.
The dockyard will be busy with workers, merchants moving their goods, and civilian traffic walking along the waterway.
Shufharz will have deliberately lowered the guard presence at the relevant docking station (moving them to the market as if in response to the attack yesterday).

Piranhas gang members will have already taken up some of their disguises when the party arrives at the docks, whilst others will simply be lying in wait.
If more gang members have been sent due to Groubun's suspicion levels, they will be present on the bridge in "over-watch".

## The Night Before: Planning

When the party returns after their foray to the Day's Rest Tavern (or with Shufharz if they failed to follow along from the docks itself), Shufharz will go over the plan and confirm what everyone is doing.
She will confirm that:

- The harbourmaster and captain are in on the plan.
- The "merchant" whose cart is being loaded up (with the goods from the ship) is a plain-clothes guard that she trusts.

Everyone else at the docks is in the dark about the scheme.
She and the detachment of guards that would normally be posted to the docking station will be patrolling the market, to give the Piranhas the impression that they are fearful of another attack in the market.
Shufharz will also remind the party that the objective is to track the Piranhas' to their hideout and arrest / "handle" their leadership, so it may be prudent to not interfere too much.

The party is free to impart any information to Shufharz that they obtained during the evening.
Shufharz won't want to make a move on Groubun (even if she is convinced by evidence the party presents) in fear of dissuading the Piranhas' attack tomorrow, though she may agree to send some guards to keep watch on the Ordo outpost.

Have the party confirm the positions that they want to take during the day tomorrow.
Shufharz has spare clothes to allow party members to dress like members of the town guard, dockworkers, or sailors (the latter can arrive on the ship by getting up early in the morning and walking upstream to meet it before it "sets off" for the town).
This is predominantly an opportunity for the party to plan for the following day, using their reconossence.
Once everyone's roles are set, allow the party to take a long rest (by staying in the barracks for the evening) before jumping time forward to the [next morning](#the-day-of-the-heist).

## The Day of the Heist

The following day will see the docks in it's usual busy state.
When the party arrives;

- There will be many dock workers present and going about their business, along with the harbourmaster organising a small group of dock-hands in preparation for the upcoming arrival.
- Another group of dock workers, along with a Foreman, will be setting up the docking crane.
- An undercover guard (posing as a merchant with a cart) will be waiting near where the road meets the docking station, expecting the delivery to be unloaded.

The exact number of dock workers and other passive NPCs is up to DM choice.
When the action kicks off, it is recommended to track at least one civilian NPC from each group of dockworkers, as well as the Foreman, as they try to escape or control the chaos.
The rest can be described as fleeing using descriptive flavour.

The gang members will have already gotten into position by the time the party arrives.
Characters that actively look out for suspicious behaviour may notice some things being out of place.
Give the player characters the opportunity to take their places and any investigative actions before the ship docks.
If the party is taking too long, the arrival of the ship can also be used to speed up or limit their preparations.

The gang members will not turn hostile (unless they really have to) until the ship has arrived.
If a character forces their hand in some way, they will use the potions of animating on nearby barrels and debris and attempt to escape.
The other gang members present on the docks will attempt to assist (likely by throwing down their own animating potions on the barrels) and then escape themselves.
In this case, the party will be forced to either capture a gang member who is present and interrogate them in order to learn the location of the hideout.
If any gang members escape, they will alert everyone in the hideout and the party will face much tougher resistance when they arrive.

Failing to capture a gang member, or otherwise learn the location of the hideout in the above circumstance, results in the party failing the adventure if they cannot track Carlton down by the end of the day.
The Piranhas successfully move the stash in their vault out of Halfyord, and plant their evidence on Faire (TSTK see possible endings FIXME).

### Gang Members Disguised as Dock workers

If the dockworker's clothes were left in the bridge stash, or weren't discovered, then two gang members will have already retrieved these disguises and taken their positions.

There will be (at least) one gang member at the docking crane, posing as a worker. The Foreman will be giving them instructions along with the rest of the group.

- (Perception DC 16) (Insight DC 14) (ADV: The dockworkers clothes were discovered in the stash) To notice one of the dock workers appears to not really know what they're meant to be doing, or appears to be new. They're essentially repeating menial tasks to make themselves look busy, but aren't actually contributing to the work.

There will be another gang member getting changed inside the warehouse.

- (Perception DC 15) To notice a dockworker leaving the warehouse, seeming to look around for a second as if not sure where to go, then join the group that the Harbourmaster is addressing.

If the dockworker's clothes were removed from the stash however, these gang members will be improvising.

- (Perception DC 25) (AUTO: See Invisibility / Detect Magic) To notice the gang member that would have been at the docking crane, now lying (invisibly) in wait near a stack of barrels next to the crane.

The other gang member will be inside the warehouse, having just ambushed and knocked a genuine dock worker, and taken their outer clothes as a disguise.
The Foreman will have sent one dockworker into the warehouse to gather some tools.
This dockworker will now be unconscious (but stable), and hidden in one of the empty tarpaulin boxes.

- (Perception DC 10) To overhear the Foreman audibly saying phrases like "has anyone seen X" (where X is a suitable name for a dockworker), "has X got those tools yet?" etc.
  - If a character dressed as a dockworker approaches the crane, the Foreman will ask them one of these questions, and send them to "see what's taking X so long".
  - Approaching the warehouse will coincide with a gang member (now wearing dockworker's clothes) leave the warehouse:
    - (Perception DC 13) The dockworker's clothes don't seem to be a particularly good fit for them.
      - 16+: This person is not carrying any tools.
    - Asking the dockworker (gang member) whether they've seen X will have them say they don't know who that is, and move to join the harbourmaster's group.
  - Investigating the warehouse will offer more insights:
    - (Investigation DC 12) (ADV: the warehouse was investigated during the night) The tool station is disturbed.
      - 14+: To notice an empty bottle on the tool station, that contains the remnants of some kind of potion.
        - (Arcana DC 13) This is the remnants of a [potion of lesser invisibility](../items/potion-of-lesser-invisibility.md).
      - 15+: To notice some scuff marks on the floor near the tool station, which lead to one of the crates covered by a tarpaulin.
      - Removing the tarpaulin and opening the crate will reveal the unconscious dockworker. They can be bought to conciousness if the character has the means, but will be unable to describe what happened. The gang member caught them by surprise from behind.

### Gang Members at the Underpass

A group of gang members will also be present at the bridge underpass, and doing a relatively poor job of disguising themselves as fishermen.
They will have different reactions to other characters approaching the group.
Again, what happens here depends on what the party did (if anything) with the hidden stash.

If the potions in the stash were removed, a character looking into the underpass will notice two "fishermen" facing the water, and another fisherman seemingly scraping at the underpass arch.
The fishermen will not be paying any particular attention to the river, and there is only a single fishing rod set up by the looks of things.

- (Nature DC 10 / Survival DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the illusion in the water) There are also seemingly no fishing supplies (nets, bait bags, etc) in the immediate area.
- (Perception DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the stash)
  - 13+: The fisherman near the wall has the reflective tooth from the water his hands, and looks confused.
  - This is because the potions are not present.
  - 16+: The character can hear the gang members talking (in Thieves's Cant) about the lack of supplies.
    - A character that is able to decipher Thieves's Cant will learn that they did bring separate [potions of animating](../items/potion-of-animating.md).

If the potions in the stash were left there (or not discovered), a character looking into the underpass will notice the "fishermen" standing in a group, handing out bottles between them.

- (Nature DC 10 / Survival DC 10) (ADV: A character knows about the illusion in the water) There are also seemingly no fishing supplies (nets, bait bags, etc) in the immediate area.
  - 15+: The bottles being passed out are nothing like what someone would use to store bait.
- (Perception DC 13) The bottles being passed out are nothing like what someone would use to store bait.
- (Arcana DC 17) The bottles being passed out look like they contain volatile, potion-like substances.

Approaching the fishermen will garner different reactions from them, based on how the character(s) look.
The gang members will - in all cases - keep up their "fishermen" ruse, unless they are pressed by the character that approaches, or the character actively hangs around the area.

- (Intimidation / Persuasion DC 16) (AUTO: Character is dressed as a guard) A character can attempt to convince the gang members to "move on".
  - The gang members will not attempt to argue with a guard.
  - A suitable bribe may also get the gang members to relocate.
  - The gang members will leave towards the civilian docks, and they will relocate to the top of the bridge in time for the ship's arrival. They will be forced to throw their potions from the bridge when animating the goods or barrels, reducing their accuracy.

If a character loiters around the underpass, when the gang kicks off it's attack, one of the "fishermen" will attempt to restrain them (or throw them in the river Hal) whilst the others begin the attack.

### Additional Gang Members

If [Groubun's suspicion](../scenes.md#groubuns-suspicion) has reached a suitable level, the gang will send additional manpower to help with the heist.
These gang members will be loitering on the bridge, overlooking the mooring station.
If one player character in particular made themselves obvious to Groubun, and this character is also on the bridge, this group might try to pre-emptively sneak up on this character before the attack begins.

These additional gang members will predominantly be using their crossbows from the bridge, and do not have any potions of animating to use on the barrels.

## The Ship's Arrival

The arrival of the ship and it's subsequent docking "triggers" the gang's attack and the combat encounter.
As the ship docks, the ship's captain will disembark to engage the harbourmaster in conversation, and the guard disguised as a merchant will move to join them and direct where they want the goods placed.
The crane will begin to move towards the ship to start unloading the heavier cargo, whilst the sailors will team up with the harbourmaster's group of dock workers to unload the cargo.

The gang members will then attack simultaneously.
If a character is aware of any of the gang members lying in wait, roll initiative to see if they get a chance to act before the gang members do.
Otherwise, the gang members will immediately act:

- The gang member near the docking crane will throw his potion of animating at what is currently being carried on the crane.
- The gang member that had joined the harbourmaster's group will animate some of the goods that are being manually unloaded.

In the interest of maximising the chances that the party gets to track either the gang or the loot, ensure that at least one group of animated cargo is near a player character (ideally the one who is holding the [Ring of Seeking](../items/ring-of-seeking.md)).

The gang members in the underpass (or now on the bridge) will use their potions of animating on the various barrels and crates scattered around the mooring station, with the intention of using them to delay any pursuit and sow general chaos in the vicinity.
If these gang members have had to relocate to the bridge, they will be forced to throw their potions from the bridge which will result in fewer barrels being caught and animated.

After this, if initiative was not rolled before, enter combat now.

### Encounter Information

Trigger: Unloading of the ship begins.
Intended difficulty: Easy / Medium

Participants based on party size: Varies

The encounter always involves:

- 5 Piranhas gang members;
  - 1 in the harbourmaster's group,
  - 1 near the docking crane,
  - 3 in the bridge underpass.
- 2 Animated loot;
  - 1 is created on the crane's cargo platform,
  - 1 is created from the goods being manually unloaded from the ship.
- 2 Animated barrels;
  - Starting position varies on what the bridge underpass group can reach.

If Groubun was suspicious, the additional group of gang members on the bridge will consist of as many gang members as there are party members.

For party sizes larger than 3, add additional combatants as below:

| Party size | Animated Loot | Animated Barrels |
|:-:|:-:|-|
| 4  |  1 |  2 |
| 5  |  2 |  2 |
| 6+ |  = (number of party members - 1) / 3 (round down) |  = number of party members / 3 (round down) |

Enemy Objectives:

- Animated loot will make a beeline for the sewers, and then the hideout vault from there. If the sewer grate is blocked, it will travel overland via the Day's Rest cellar entrance.
- Animated barrels are controlled by the Piranhas gang members, and should be used to disrupt tracking efforts.
  - For parties with good or neutral aligned characters, having some of the barrels attack the dockworkers, or put them in positions of peril, can create useful dilemma situations.
  - The barrels can also be used to tie down party members, and their pushing abilities can be used to knock characters into the river.
- Piranhas gang members will attempt to flee once they're confident the Animated Loot has gotten away.
  - All gang members have a [potion of lesser invisibility](../items/potion-of-lesser-invisibility.md) to help their escape.
  - If it becomes obvious to the gang members that there was some kind of preparation or ambush setup for them, they will attempt to flee back to the Day's Rest to warn Fordem. Otherwise, they will scatter into the town and beyond, and will not be present in the hideout.

### Initial Locations

- 1 Piranhas gang member near the docking crane (either disguised or invisible).
- 1 Piranhas gang member near "helping" with the manual unloading (disguised).
- 3 Piranhas gang members (the underpass group) either in the bridge underpass, or potentially on the bridge.
- Additional gang members resulting from Groubun's suspicion start on the bridge.
- Animated loot starts in two places (split the total number evenly, giving the extra entity in the event of an uneven split to the crane platform).
  - Half start in the manual unloading area.
  - The other half start on the crane platform.
- The start position of the Animated Barrels should be chosen based on what is within range of the underpass Piranhas group.
  - Animated barrels can be reflavoured as general crates, loose sacks, pallets, or even bridge statuary if wanting to provide some variety.
  - If the underpass group had to relocate to the bridge, **halve** the number of animated barrels.

### Other Encounter Factors

- Civilians will attempt to scatter once the fighting begins, but may get caught in the crossfire with the Animated Barrels and Animated Loot.
- The guard posing as the merchant will prioritise helping the civilians get to safety, trusting in the party's abilities.
- Animated Loot will use the sewers to reach the vault, and the party may decide to follow it through the sewers.
  - The Ring of Seeking will lead the party through the sewers, until the loot arrives in the vault at which point it will be sealed. The path will then lead out of the sewers and via the Day's Rest cellar entrance.
  - If the route via the sewer grate that opens into the river is blocked, it will attempt to travel by via the cellar too. This will make it much easier to track through the town, and impact the state of the Day's Rest when the party gets there.

### Loot

- Gang members carry their usual necklaces, and the party can acquire their potions of lesser invisibility if they don't get a chance to use them.

### Notes

The main thing to keep in mind when running this fight is that the party needs a means of tracking either the gang members or the loot to the hideout.
As such, ensure there is enough of a chance for the party member with the Ring of Seeking to mark an Animated Loot, or that party members are near enough to give chase to the fleeing gang members.
Worst case, the party can also capture a gang member, who can then be used to push them in the correct direction.

## Tracking the Loot

Once the dust settles, Shufharz will briefly rendezvous with the party if the situation calls for it.
Otherwise, the party should take the lead in following either the gang members or the animated cargo (using the Ring of Seeking if necessary).
Shufharz will not accompany the party for this due to the chaos on the docks.

If using the Ring of Seeking, the party can follow the trail back to the hideout underneath the Day's Rest.
If pursuing gang members, stealth checks contested by the gang member's passive perception will be needed, or survival checks if line of sight was lost before pursuit began.
In order to solidify the link to the Day's Rest, the gang members that are part of the heist can exclaim they recognise the party from the night before if the party participated in the [fighting ring](./05-the-days-rest-tavern.md#fighting-ring) or [card game](./05-the-days-rest-tavern.md#a-game-of-cards).
Similarly, allow the party characters to do suitable checks to recognise the gang members from the night before.

- (Stealth) (Contested by gang member's Perception) (DIS: The gang members are invisible and the Ring of Seeking is not active) The gang members do not realise they are being tracked.
  - If failed, they will continue to flee but might turn and fight if an opportunity present itself.
- (Survival DC 10) (AUTO: Ring of seeking is actively tracking a target heading to the hideout) To follow the trail of the fleeing gang members or Animated Loot.

The cargo (if above ground) can be followed without worry of alerting it - in fact, members of the public will gladly point the way / be in shock if the cargo ends up travelling to the hideout via the streets not the sewers.
Hope in the next scene will also be able to share more information if the cargo comes in the front door.

## Next Scenes

The party should return follow the trail to the Day's Rest, and gain access to the hideout.
Proceed to [Infiltrating the Hideout](./07-infiltrating-the-hideout.md).
