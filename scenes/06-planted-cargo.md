# The Planted Cargo

After completing their investigations for the evening, the party returns to the barracks for rest and to plan the following day with Shufharz.
This scene covers the execution of Shufharz' plan to lure out the Piranhas gang and track them to their headquarters.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Provides the main plot hook for the party to track the Piranhas to their hideout.

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have successfully tracked either the gang or a piece of animated loot to the hideout in The Day's Rest.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- Though indirectly, the party can learn that more gang members have been sent than they might have planned. This is an indicator that Groubun is suspicious.

## Setting

The [planning stage](#the-night-before-planning) takes place in the barracks, either in Shufharz' "war room" or in Kamonas' office with the governor present.
The party will be offered bed and board here for the evening.

The next day, the scene takes place at the docks, during the day rather than the evening.
The dockyard will be busy with workers, merchants moving their goods, and civilian traffic walking along the waterway.
Shufharz will have deliberately lowered the guard presence at the relevant docking station (moving them to the market as if in response to the attack yesterday).

Piranhas gang members will have already taken up some of their disguises when the party arrives at the docks, whilst others will simply be lying in wait.
If more gang members have been sent due to Groubun's suspicion levels, they will be present on the bridge in "over-watch".

## The Night Before: Planning

When the party returns after their foray to the Day's Rest Tavern (or with Shufharz if they failed to follow along from the docks itself), Shufharz will go over the plan and confirm what everyone is doing.
She will confirm that:

- The harbourmaster and captain are in on the plan.
- The "merchant" whose cart is being loaded up (with the goods from the ship) is a plain-clothes guard that she trusts.

Everyone else at the docks is in the dark about the scheme.
She and the detachment of guards that would normally be posted to the docking station will be patrolling the market, to give the Piranhas the impression that they are fearful of another attack in the market.
Shufharz will also remind the party that the objective is to track the Piranhas' to their hideout and arrest / "handle" their leadership, so it may be prudent to not interfere too much.

The party is free to impart any information to Shufharz that they obtained during the evening.
Shufharz won't want to make a move on Groubun (even if she is convinced by evidence the party presents) in fear of dissuading the Piranhas' attack tomorrow, though she may agree to send some guards to keep watch on the Ordo outpost.

Have the party confirm the positions that they want to take during the day tomorrow.
Shufharz has spare clothes to allow party members to dress like members of the town guard, dockworkers, or sailors (the latter can arrive on the ship by getting up early in the morning and walking upstream to meet it before it "sets off" for the town).
This is predominantly an opportunity for the party to plan for the following day, using their reconossence.
Once everyone's roles are set, allow the party to take a long rest (by staying in the barracks for the evening) before jumping time forward to the next morning.
