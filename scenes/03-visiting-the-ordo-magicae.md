# The Ordo Magicae

The party is sent to the Ordo Magicae by Shufharz to pick up a delivery, before meeting her at the docks.

This scene serves to do the following things:

- Introduces the characters at the Ordo Magicae.
- Allows the party to begin their investigation.
- Ensures the party has an item to allow them to track the cargo in [the relevant scene](./06-planted-cargo.md).

At the end of the scene, the party should hopefully:

- Have gathered some information from the Ordo Magicae about:
  - Groubun and Jenessa's disposition towards Faire.
  - They might have suspicions of Groubun after meeting him in the lab.
  - They may look around the Ordo when left unsupervised to find more clues.

The party can also obtain the following information:

- The party can get both Jenessa's and Groubun's account of Faire's disappearance
  - The two can also be convinced to share their opinions of Faire.
  - They can also be asked about the wider structure of guild, and notably the procedure for what will happen in Faire's absence.
- They can identify suspicious materials in the lab, similar to any that were identified at the market.
  - Groubun can be challenged on the potions he is making, for which he has a lie prepared.
  - The lab & store stocks will be mostly bare save for these materials.
- They can find the schematics for the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md) in Groubun's notebook.
- They can learn of Faire's current academic position.
  - His lab notebook will contain essentially gibberish and experiments destined to fail.
  - Around the Ordo are several recent publications, but Faire's name only appears on joint publications with Groubun.
- They can learn more about Jenessa's and Groubun's backstories if the manage to sneak into their rooms.
  - Jenessa's is fairly innocuous, but it will validate her visit to the Herbalist on the day of Faire's disappearance.
  - Groubun's room contains more interesting reading material; letters from this family and partially burnt notes from Carlton.

## Setting

This scene takes place in: The Ordo Magicae Guildhall / Outpost

The party will walk back down Governor's walk, through the now-cordoned-off market square, towards the Ordo Magicae Guildhall.
It will now be close to early evening - businesses appear to be shutting for the day, and many people can be seen heading to taverns, theatres, or other entertainment venues.
The general mood on the streets has not changed much since the party left the market square though; and this can be another place to call for [the checks in scene 2](./02-hired-help.md#the-walk-from-the-market), if the party doesn't have this information already.
They will arrive at the Ordo Magicae building to find it open, though not much activity can be seen on the ground (shop) floor - the lights are on and the shop is open, though.

The party will arrive to find Jenessa preparing to close up the shop that runs from the ground floor of the Ordo.
Groubun will be in the lab - officially working on experiments but in reality putting the finishing touches on some more potions for the heist tomorrow, which he is planning to deliver to the Piranhas tonight.
The other Ordo staff members are absent, save for one who is taking a break in the living area on the middle floor of the building.

### Groubun's Suspicion

This scene is the first opportunity for Groubun's suspicion to come into play, if you are tracking it.
Its value persists through all subsequent scenes, and you should start tracking it here.

## Meeting Jenessa

As the party enters the shop, Jenessa will mistake them for potential customers due to their adventuring garb or demeanour.
She will begin explaining that the shop is about to close for the day, and make an offhand comment that "there isn't much to browse anyway".

The party can ask her for information before revealing they are working with Shufharz, and she will give the public-facing responses.
She will not divulge she is helping with the investigation, nor details about what the Ordo is doing to assist.
If asked for details about the Ordo, she will share information about the outpost's purpose, organisational structure, staff, and current supply problems.

Once the party reveals they are working with Shufharz, she will open up to their questions and properly close up the shop.
After the conversation, or during it should it last longer than it takes her to close the shop, she will suggest they continue the conversation upstairs in the lab.
She can also remind herself of the item that the party came to collect, as an excuse to have them follow her upstairs.

Jenessa will be upfront with her information, but she does not enjoy talking negatively of people nor the Ordo's current situation.
She will instead make suggestive comments, like Faire's appointment has been a "difficult transition" or that the Ordo is facing "problems with supply", but not reveal the depth of the issue.
She can be convinced to speak a bit more plainly though:

- (Persuasion DC 13, ADV: Roleplay has given the Jenessa a positive disposition towards the party) Jenessa will be more forthcoming in her responses. She will outright say that Faire has been a detriment since he arrived and is putting a lot of pressure on the other guild members if previously asked. Likewise she will comment on the severity of the supply situation. She will also mention Groubun seems to be doing a much better job that Faire ever was.

When leading the party upstairs, have Jenessa give a polite request / notice to the party that the 2nd floor of the guildhall is off-limits to non-guild members.
This is mostly just an invitation to the players that there might be extra information to be found in the guildhall - proceed to [Sneaking Around](#sneaking-around) if a player takes the bait, possibly running two events in parallel.

- (Stealth vs Jenessa's passive perception, ADV: Jenessa is actively engaged in conversation with another character) A character can slip away from the group un-noticed to investigate the guildhall.
- (Persuasion DC 5) A character can excuse themselves from the group for a while, EG to use a bathroom or wait outside for a suitable reason. The guild member they make the excuse to will notice a prolonged absence, if there is a reason for this (EG bathroom break).

## The Lab

Jenessa will lead the party to the 1st floor of the Ordo, and into the lab where she thinks she left the item the party came to collect.
When they arrive, Groubun will be found brewing potions in the lab and will already have a couple of bottles prepared.
On a desk with the completed bottles will be his research log - this will be open on the page with a draft design for the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md), Whiskers is currently wearing the finalised design.
The shelves around the lab will contain a large number of empty jars and bottles, as if supply is short.
The only ingredients in abundance are those that Groubun uses to make his potions of animating, which he gets from the Piranhas.
Faire's workstation is a cluttered mess of papers, books, and partially cleaned flasks and other containers.

Groubun will notice the party's entry and greet them cordially, and Jenessa will explain they're just here to pick up a delivery.
The party will have the option to speak to Groubun in the lab, and he will share the following information if asked:

- His version of events leading up to Faire's disappearance.
- He will be more forthcoming and direct about Faire's research abilities and skills as Ordinator. He will not share his academic struggles though.
- He will also outline the supply problems the Ordo is now facing. If questioned about the potion supplies, have him [comment in the same way](#the-potions-being-brewed) as if someone challenges what potions he is brewing.
- (Insight, DC 10) A character will pick up on the disdain that Groubun has when talking about Faire as his supervisor.
- (Persuasion, DC 15) Groubun can be convinced to share the information that Faire has essentially been leaning on him for any kind of research output.

Groubun will be very protective of the lab equipment, and request that the party do not touch anything.
He will also disapprove of them poking around too much in the lab.
Once any conversation with Groubun is done, have Jenessa ask him where he last saw the [Ring of Seeking](../items/ring-of-seeking.md) she made (though don't refer to it by it's formal name).
Groubun should respond that he moved it out of the room and put it downstairs in the store, assuming she made it to be sold.
Jenessa will excuse herself to retrieve it.
If uninterrupted, Groubun will start bottling up the substances he is brewing, will place them into his satchel bag, then excuse himself to head upstairs and sort some paperwork.
He will take his logbook with him when he leaves the lab.
In reality of course, is not planning to head to the temple after completing the paperwork - he is going to the Day's Rest.

### Investigations and Conversation Topics

The party should be free to look around the lab, whilst both Groubun and Jenessa are there and in the time between them leaving and Jenessa returning with her item.
However, intrusive snooping around the lab will annoy Groubun, which may make him excuse himself early and will add a suspicion point to his tally.

If Groubun leaves early, Jenessa will brush it off when he returns with an offhand comment like "he's under a lot of pressure" or "he's handling acting as Ordinator very well, but it has hit his research time" when she returns.
If he does not leave before Jenessa returns, he will excuse himself before she explains what the [Ring of Seeking](../items/ring-of-seeking.md) does.

#### The Potions being Brewed

Groubun is actually brewing [potions of animating](../items/potion-of-animating.md), which he normally feels confident about doing in the lab since the other members of the Ordo do not specialise in Alchemy.

The party might ask Groubun what he is brewing, and at first Groubun will be defensive about it (albeit in a cordial manner) and lie that it is a batch of healing salves for the temple.
If questioned about the materials, he can claim the temple supplied them from their donations.

- (Investigation, DC 20) (Arcana, DC 15) (Detect Magic / Identify) Upon inspection, the potions produced do not appear to give off the magical essence typically associated with healing potions. A roll of 10 in any of the two checks will simply reveal that the potions don't look like typical healing potions.
  - If Groubun is confronted with the above assessment, he will smirk slightly (as if in appreciation for knowledge) and confirm the character's investigation. He'll go on to say that these salves instead work by physically stitching and morphing the body to repair itself, rather than the "usual" healing method of revitalising the body.
    - (Arcana, DC 20) This explanation seems plausible, but typically magical essences do not care about *how* an effect takes place, only the nature of the effect.
    - (Insight, DC 20) This explanation seems plausible, but there was an ever so short pause between the question and Groubun's answer.
    - If either check is not passed, the character in question just thinks the explanation seems plausible.

If Groubun has left after pouring his potions into bottles;

- (Investigation DC 17) (Arcana DC 15) A character notices that Groubun left an empty petri dish / syringe next to his brewing equipment that contains traces of these abundant ingredients.
  - (Nature DC 15) (Survival DC 20) will identify the ingredients as similar to any traces found in the potion remnants of the market attack. If the party does not yet have this information, no extra information is gained (but the party will now recognise the traces in the future).

#### Looking at the Logbooks

The party can also attempt to examine either Faire or Groubun's notebooks.
Groubun will be annoyed at the party examining his notebook without asking, but if they ask to take a look he will outright refuse since it is his academic livelihood, and where his future publications will come from.

- (Stealth, DC 15 DIS: Groubun is not engaged in conversation) A character can try to examine Groubun's notebook, where they will see a draft design for the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md).
  - (On failure) Groubun notices the character doing this and gets defensive, claiming that the research in his notebook has yet to be published and to not get any ideas. This will trigger his early exit from the scene, and adds 1 point to Groubun's suspicion.
  - If a character passes the stealth check and openly asks Groubun about the design, he will still get defensive but will play off the character's ignorance in not knowing it was groundbreaking research. He will still leave the scene early and add 1 point to his suspicion though.

Groubun however does not care if the party looks through Faire's notebook.
However, still have a character make a stealth check against Groubun's passive perception if they look through Faire's logbook in his presence.

- (Investigation, DC 12) (Arcana DC 10) Inspecting his notebook will reveal that most of what's written is nonsense or garbage, with very speculative ideas that have no real applications.
  - (Stealth check was failed) Groubun will make a comment on how most of what's in Faire's notebook is nonsense. He does not take a point of suspicion, but does scoop up his own notebook if he hasn't done so already.
  - (Persuasion, DC 14) Groubun can be convinced to share that Faire is "past his prime". He will also comment on how most of what's in the logbook is nonsense, and Faire has been relying on him to produce any research output as of late.
    - 18+: Groubun will also reveal that Faire gets most of the credit for this research, despite it predominantly being Groubun's work.

A character can also inspect Faire's desk for clues about his disappearance.

- (Investigation DC 17) The character notices a coffee cup that appears to have been used as a container for an ingredient. If the party has already noted which ingredients are in abundance in the lab, the character can identify it in the same way as Groubun's petri dish.
  - This is how Groubun administered the potion that transformed Faire, though do not reveal this information to the party of course!

#### Poking Around the Lab

The party can also poke around the lab itself.
Groubun will disapprove of them doing this, and will scoop up his notebook if the party is not subtle about it.
If they investigate too many things, or start moving apparatus about, or poking inside cupboards, Groubun will chastise them.
If they persist, give Groubun 1 point of suspicion and have him leave early with his logbook and potions.

Just looking around the lab at the stocks can reveal some information.

- (Investigation DC 12) (Perception DC 15) A character notices that all the shelves bar a particular selection of alchemical supplies are almost out of stock, or are out of stock entirely.
  - Note that they are not well-stocked, but they are certainly not bare like the rest of the shelves.
  - 16+: Those ingredients that are present on the shelves are also laid out in measured quantities near Groubun's brewing station.
  - (Nature DC 15) (Survival DC 20) will identify the ingredients as similar to any traces found in the potion remnants of the market attack. If the party does not yet have this information, no extra information is gained (but the party will now recognise the traces in the future).
  - Jenessa can be asked about this situation, and she will lament the Ordo's supply situation and explain the presence of the ingredients with an offhand comment like "it's just where Groubun has put the materials provided by the temple" or something to that effect.

If the party is struggling to identify the ingredients, there is an alembic / encyclopedia in one of the cupboards in the lab, which they can look around for.
Groubun will not share this information, but Jenessa will if she is back.
Of course, rummaging around in the cupboards will annoy Groubun as described above, but the party will eventually find the book.
Having the book provides advantage on the checks in this scene to identify the (properties of the) ingredients Groubun is using, or allows a character to re-roll one of these checks that has already been failed in light of the new information.

### The Ring of Seeking

Jenessa will return shortly after Groubun leaves (if he leaves early) or once there's a suitable gap in the action.
The players might choose to ask her about the supply situation or various pieces of apparatus in the lab, before or after she explains her item.

Once other conversation topics are out of the way, Jenessa will hand the [Ring of Seeking](../items/ring-of-seeking.md) to a party member (preferably a non-magical character, though the party can of course decide who has the ring later).
She will then explain how it works, and also mention that she is able to recharge it for them if the charge runs dry.

- (Persuasion DC 15) Jenessa can be convinced to part with 2 potions of minor healing (2d4+4) if the party provides a convincing argument.
  - If the party mentions the plan at the docks tomorrow as part of their argument or reasoning, Groubun - even if he has already gone upstairs - gains 1 suspicion point.

After answering any more questions the party might have, she will excuse herself and show the party out of the building.

## Sneaking Around

Party members might attempt to look around the Ordo Magicae unsupervised.
This event / section provides details of the information that is available for them to recover, in the various rooms of the guildhall.
There are also some recommended difficulty checks that should be tied to uncovering certain pieces of information.

### The Shop Front

Poking around the shop front (ground floor) only reveals what observation would have earlier - the shelves are bare and it looks like they have been for a while.
However there are a few things that can be uncovered:

- On the counter is a logbook with a list of orders. A number of them have a note next to them - written by Jenessa - that say "delayed due to lack of materials", or something else to that effect. The logbook essentially reveals that the Ordo is unable to fulfil any commissions it has taken on due to the supply problem, and is stalling for time from the benefactors.
- The counter has a cupboard built into the bottom of it, accessible through locked cabinet doors on the vendor side of the desk.
  - (Thieves' Tools DC 17) To pick the lock and open the counter. Inside the party will find 2 potions of lesser healing (2d4+2), which are the same potions that Jenessa can be convinced to offer the party.
  - If Jenessa is convinced to give the potions to the party, and they have already been taken from the cabinet, have her put this down to having sold them in the previous week and simply forgotten she did. If the lock was *not* re-locked after breaking in though, she will be suspicious and you should provide appropriate repercussions on the party.

### The 1st Floor

Besides the lab, the first floor has the common area and the living quarters for the Ordo staff, excluding Groubun and Faire's quarters of course.
In the common area there will be bookcases with copies of recent publications by the guildhall's members, as well as a general notice board for announcements like that which might be found in a modern-day office.

- Reading the notice board, there are a couple of items that might be worthy of the party's attention.
  - A character will always notice an article that is pinned to the board, which has the seal of the Ordo Magicae on it. It is essentially a builtin reporting on Faire's initial disappearance, and also laying out the procedure that the guildhall in Halfyord should follow for the time being.
  - (Investigation DC 5) (Perception DC 5) The character notices that another notice from the guild is pinned to the board, underneath a couple of other notices that have started to overlap with it. It is the guild's newsletter (or fantasy equivalent of such a thing) that reported on Faire's appointment as Ordinator.
  - 10+: There are (abstracts of) recent publications by Faire and Groubun pinned to the board too.
  - 15+: Faire's name only appears with Groubun's in the publications, and is always listed first.
- In one of the bookshelves will be the charter of the Ordo Magicae, a copy of which is usually found in every guildhall.
  - (History, DC 10) (Automatic: member of the Ordo Magicae) Slimmed-down versions of these handbooks are also given out to new guild members when they join.
  - (Investigation, DC 15) (History, DC 10 - only if the above history check was passed by the same character) The character can flick through the handbook to find the rules about Ordinator succession, as it applies in a situation like this. This will reveal that Groubun is acting Ordinator (which the party should have known already) but note that this is written into the charter, so is standard practice for an Apprentice to take charge in the event of the Ordinator's disappearance, at least temporarily.

The living quarters on the 1st floor do not hold any plot-relevant information, save for in Jenessa's room where her journal records her visit to the herbalist on the day Faire went missing.

- (Thieves' Tools, DC 15) To break into any of the living quarters on the 1st floor.
- If the party is looking for some light theft, roll on a suitable loot table. The staff that live on this floor are not particularly wealthy, but are not lower class either.

### The 2nd Floor

The second floor of the guildhall contains Faire and Groubun's rooms, as well as another bathroom (this is mainly there to provide a character some form of cover if they are upstairs when Groubun leaves the lab).
Both of the rooms on this floor are slightly more opulent than the functional lodgings on the floor below.
They each have a private desk and small hearth, along with a larger wardrobe and bed.
There are also several containers in the room for personal storage, and arm chairs for private relaxation away from the common room.

The door to Faire's room is labelled above the door frame with "Ordinator's quarters".
Groubun's room does not have such a label above the door.

Groubun and Faire's rooms, unlike the rooms on the 1st floor, are protected by an *alarm* spell on the doors to the rooms.
Faire of course won't receive his warning due to being a cat, wearing the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md), and being across town in another building, not that he could do anything about it even if it did receive it.
Groubun however *will* be notified if someone enters his room without disabling the alarm first - this immediately adds 2 suspicion points to his tally and makes him leave the lab early (with potions and logbook) to investigate what is going on.

### Faire's Room

Faire's room is protected by an alarm spell, but is not locked.

- (Perception, DC 15) (Investigation, DC 15) (Automatic, the player has noticed the alarm glyph on Groubun's room) A character notices the glyphs that sustain the alarm spell.
  - (Arcana 15) (Dispel Magic) The glyphs can be dispelled without raising the alarm.

Inside Faire's room, there will be a number of pristinely cleaned robes in the wardrobe, that have clearly been given a glow-up since Faire moved in.
(This is Faire trying to make himself look fancy and important through his dress).
There are a couple of useful pieces of information, or clues, in the room though:

- (Investigation, DC 10) It is clear that Faire is fond of cats. There is a small pencil holder on his desk in the shape of a cat, and a statue on the windowsill also shaped like a cat. There is also an sketch of a cat in a frame on the wall above the desk.
  - 15+: Faire's desk has a lot of forms and other official documents strewn across it, that are not filled in. There is a sticky note on a pile of them which just says "give to Jenessa".
  - 20+: Faire seems to be drafting a lot of letters to other members of the Ordo, but there don't appear to be any responses.
    - (History, DC 15) (Arcana, DC 15) (Can only be attempted if the character would know the internal structure of the Ordo Magicae) The letter addressees are other prominent researchers within the Ordo Magicae. The kind you would normally expect to collaborate with other prominent researchers in their respective fields.
    - If the letters are read, their contents is essentially Faire proposing some collaborative research. A character can attempt [the same check](#looking-at-the-logbooks) as found in Faire's logbook to discern that the experiments / research paths that Faire is proposing are nonsensical.

### Groubun's Room

Groubun's room is protected by an alarm spell, and is also locked.
There is window access from 2 floors above street level, from the main street the guildhall is built onto - this will not trigger the alarm spell, but if the door later opened from the inside, it will!

- (Perception, DC 20) (Investigation, DC 20) (Automatic, the player has noticed the alarm glyph on Faire's room) A character notices the glyphs that sustain the alarm spell.
  - (Arcana 15) (Dispel Magic) The glyphs can be dispelled without raising the alarm.

Groubun's room is much tidier than Faire's, and also much more functional.
There are few personal furnishings that are visible upon entry.

The hearth is warm as if it was put out not recently, but also not long ago.
Groubun has burnt the most recent note (requesting potions) that he got from Fordem on his last visit to The Day's Rest.

- (Investigation, DC 15) A character notices the corner of a piece of paper in the hearth. The rest of the page is missing, as if the remainder of the note or letter was burnt in the fireplace. There are no discernable markings on the small scrap that is left.
- (Survival, DC 15) Something naturally flammable was recently burnt in the hearth, as can be deduced from the ashes that have blown with the draft towards the edges of the fireplace. This leads the character to notice the scrap of paper mentioned above.
  - 20+: The note as likely burnt within the day.

Groubun's desk is organised but busy.
There are unfinished manuscripts piled into an "out" tray, and unread correspondence in a "in" tray.
On the desk itself will be an opened letter from Groubun's parents, partially tucked into it's envelope.

- (Investigation, DC 10) A character notices the opened letter from on Groubun's desk. The letter is written in Dwarvish.
  - (History, DC 15 - ADV Affinity / familiarity with dwarven society in character background) The character recognises the family name of the sender, "Stoneclimber" as a fairly prominent, if minor, Dwarvish nobility.
  - (Forgery Kit, DC 10) To make a copy of the letter's contents, to show to another party member later.
  - The following checks require that a character is able to read the letter.
    - (Insight, DC 15) (Investigation, DC 20) The letter is from Groubun's parents, and seems to be passively chastising him for his lack of progression in his chosen career. The letter quotes the successes of his siblings, and questions how wise his decision to study under Faire was.
- Investigating the manuscripts or unread correspondence will not reveal any information that is relevant to the adventure. It is a combination of papers Groubun is reading from other academics, unfinished drafts that Groubun is clearly planning to submit, and ideas for his own experiments.
- (Investigation, DC 20) (The scrap of paper in the fireplace has been found) There are no stray envelopes on Groubun's desk.

Groubun will not notice if the letter on his desk is moved slightly in a character's investigation.
He will however notice if the letter is moved off the desk - mark 1 suspicion point in this case, unless he has already accrued at least one suspicion point from the character breaking into his room (EG raising the alarm).

## Next Scenes

After the party takes their leave from the Ordo, they should proceed to [Scouting the Docks](./04-scouting-the-docks.md) next.
