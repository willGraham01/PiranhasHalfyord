# The Piranhas of Halfyord

## What is this Adventure?

FIXME 

The Piranhas of Halfyord was initially intended to be an introductory story that would setup a "Western Marches" setting or campaign.
It is a light-hearted adventure that tries to balance simplicity with enough investigative elements to still be interesting, as well as providing a number of "combat" encounters where the objective of the aggressors isn't necessarily to outright kill the defendants.

The adventure tries to balance around a party of 4 level 3 characters, though the relevant section for each combat has some ideas for adapting to greater / larger numbers.
Each scene also tries to provide enough investigative / social angles so that every character in the party can be doing something.
