# Faire Ron-Ron

## Backstory

A career wizard now past their prime.
Faire is reaching his late 700s, which is quite old even for an elf.
He has been magically gifted from a young age, joining the Ordo in his late 100s and being involved in a number of (at the time) leading research projects and innovations.
However with age has bought poor judgement, and Faire has struggled to replicate the academic successes of his early career for the past century, becoming increasingly more reliant on his apprentice(s) for actual research output.
Despite this, Faire remains oblivious - perhaps even hostile - to the idea that he is past his prime and it would be best for him to take a backseat and let younger talent rise through the ranks.
It is this stubbornness that resulted in his "promotion" to Ordinator in Halfyord - he is now out of the way of the research scene.

Faire has largely neglected his duties as Ordinator, pressing them onto Jenessa.
He has also continued to elbow his way onto Groubun's research papers - and using his name weight to take a lot of the credit for the ideas they contain.
He does fulfil what he deems the important roles of an Ordinator, such as attending council meetings, public speaking, etc - anything that he feels befits his station and improves people's opinion of how important he is.

## Appearance & Personality

Faire is around 5"11', with a lean (almost scrawny) build and aging, pale skin.
His hair is a medium length, but is completely grey and almost white in places - he has no facial hair and prominent ears (even by elven standards).
His facial features are angular and sharp, with no signs of injury or harm to them.

Faire only ever wears robes that carry the status of Ordinator.
The robe itself has long, billowed sleeves with a mixture of upper class colours like purple and red, with gold and silver trimmings.
There is a hood for wet weather, and a belt around his waist that has coin purses and a keyring.
He is also wearing enchanted rings and a gold necklace.

Faire typically carries a staff that he uses as a spellcasting focus and also has a typically show-y design.
However, he has been separated from this due to his erstwhile transformation.

Faire is blinded by his sense of self-importance and belief that he is still a genius whose contribution to magical-science cannot be understated.
He is likely to act confused when challenged by someone of (what he deems) a lower station.
He gets particularly defensive about his career - secretly one of his greatest fears is becoming irrelevant and fading from history.
His speech is akin to a modern politician - trying not to let on that he might not have all the answers whilst also being quite vague and condescending at times.

## Relations

Faire believes that both Groubun and Jenessa look up to him as a guide and mentor, and enjoy the responsibilities that he treats them to.
He sees Kamonas as an equally important member of the town's governing body, and would likely go so far as to say his words carry heavy weight on Kamonas' opinion.
He dislikes Shufharz as she is not afraid to ask direct questions that he doesn't have the answers to, but is too proud to admit.
