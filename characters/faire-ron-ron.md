## Backstory

A career wizard now past their prime.
Faire is reaching his late 600s, which is quite old even for an elf.
He has been magically gifted from a young age, joining the Ordo in his late 100s and being involved in a number of (at the time) cutting-edge research projects and innovations.
His early career success, combined with the natural longevity of elven lifespans, resulted in a rather splendid career that has spanned several centuries.

As the years have gone on however, Faire has both become a victim of his success and been warped by it.
With his research successes, Faire was able to secure more funding for his research projects, expeditions, and teams.
The more funding he secured, the more administrative responsibilities he suddenly had, but he also had more Apprentices to manage and supervise the work of.
This culminated in Faire gradually de-skilling as the years went on, to the point where nowadays he is completely out of touch with the academic landscape and relies on his Apprentices to publish work that he attaches his name to.

Despite his loss of skills however, Faire remains oblivious - perhaps even hostile - to the idea that he is past his prime and it would be best for him to take a back-seat and let younger talent rise through the ranks.
Furthermore, his reputation means that new Apprentices to the Ordo are always keen to work with him, as they haven't become acquainted with the wider order and thus discovered Faire's real abilities.
And besides, who are they to question their renowned supervisor with centuries of experience?

It is this egotism that resulted in Faire's "promotion" to Ordinator in Halfyord.
The other high ranking members of the Ordo were able to present it as a promotion, knowing Faire would accept the position if it was framed in this way.
This has since freed up other, more academically versed members of the Ordo a share of the funding and been an overhaul benefit to the health of the organisation.
Faire however has largely neglected his duties as Ordinator, pressing them onto Jenessa.
He has also continued to elbow his way onto Groubun's research papers - and using the weight his name carries to take a lot of the credit for the ideas they contain.
He does fulfil what he deems the important roles of an Ordinator, such as attending council meetings and meeting other high-ranking visitors from the Ordo - essentially anything that he feels befits his station and improves people's opinion of how important he is.
He has also become very unpopular with the city council because of his attitude towards others.

## Appearance & Personality

Faire only ever wears robes that carry the status of Ordinator, always in pristine condition.
The robe itself has long, billowed sleeves with a mixture of upper class colours like purple and red, with gold and silver trimmings.
There is a hood for wet weather, and a belt around his waist that has coin purses and a keyring.
He is also wearing valuable-looking rings and a gold necklace, and although they look magical, they are in fact not.
Faire typically carries a staff that he uses as a spellcasting focus and also has a typically show-y design.
However, he has been separated from this due to his erstwhile transformation.

Faire is around 5"11', with a lean (almost scrawny) build and ageing, pale skin.
His hair falls passed his shoulders, but is completely grey and almost white in places - he has no facial hair and prominent ears (even by elven standards).
His facial features are angular and sharp, with no signs of injury or harm to them.

Faire is blinded by his sense of self-importance and belief that he is still a genius whose contribution to magical-science cannot be understated.
He is likely to act confused when challenged by someone of (what he deems) a lower station.
He gets particularly defensive about his career - secretly one of his greatest fears is becoming irrelevant and fading from history.
His speech is akin to a modern politician - trying not to let on that he might not have all the answers whilst also being quite vague and condescending at times.

## Relations

- Groubun: Faire believes he is the greatest thing to happen to Groubun's career, and that Groubun looks up to him as a mentor and research partner. Being transformed of course changes this, but he may revert to this state if given [Groubun's antidote](../items/potion-of-corporeal-resetting.md).
- Jenessa: Faire treats Jenessa as little more than a personal secretary. One of her roles is to keep the guildhall running, so it is natural that the Ordinator be able to delegate tasks to her.
- Kamonas: Faire sees Kamonas as an equally important member of the town's governing body, and would likely go so far as to say his words carry heavy weight on Kamonas' opinion.
- Shufharz: Faire Shufharz for a number of reasons; she is not afraid to ask direct questions that he doesn't have the answers to, but is too proud to admit. She is not afraid to call his out on his hastily made-up answers. She is also not a noble-born and does not act with the manners that should be afforded to the city council.
- Hope: Faire is not fond of his new carer at the Day's Rest, to put it mildly. He does begrudgingly accept that she is his source of food and water, though.
- Fordem: Faire knows Fordem is a member of the Piranhas, but mostly hates him for his involvement in his present confinement.
- Carlton: Much like Fordem, although Faire is unaware of who Carlton is, only knowing him as the person who seems to be in charge in the hideout.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

Faire holds a large amount of useful information, but of course spends the majority of the adventure [as a cat](./whiskers.md) that cannot speak nor be spoken to.

- He knows that Groubun is aiding the Piranhas.
- He knows the location of the Piranhas hideout, though he does not know how to get in via the vault.
- He does not fully comprehend Groubun's motivations, and if asked will hypothesise it as jealousy.

Note that if Faire is transformed back into himself by [administering the antidote](../items/potion-of-corporeal-resetting.md) Groubun has prepared, he will forget everything he experienced as a cat.
This will include Groubun's responsibility for his transformation, collaboration with the Piranhas, and the location of their hideout.

**Past his Prime**: Faire has disadvantage on all Intelligence (Arcana) checks he makes.
Any spell attack rolls that he makes are also made with disadvantage.
Creatures forced to make a saving throw because of the effect of one of his spells make this save with advantage.
If Faire attempts to use a spell that discerns the effects of magical items or auras, such as Identify or Detect Magic, he must first succeed on a DC 15 intelligence check, otherwise the spell slot is expended and there is no effect.

**Lack of Focus**: Faire cannot cast any spells of level 2 or greater unless he is in possession of his staff, which he uses as an arcane focus.

### Actions in Combat

Faire can cast a levelled spell or a cantrip.
If desperate, he can also attack with his staff if he has it to hand.

**Quarterstaff**: *Melee weapon attack*, -2 to hit, reach 5ft., 1 target. Hit; 1 (1d6 - 2) bludgeoning damage.

### Spellcasting

Faire knows (or at least, claims to) a wide range of spells from his career in the Ordo Magicae.
He knows the following spells by memory, but will need either his staff or spellbook - both of which are at the Ordo guildhall - to cast any other spells.
Intelligence is his spellcasting ability, his spell attack bonus is +7 and his spell save DC is 15.

Cantrips:

- Firebolt

Level 1 (4 / day):
