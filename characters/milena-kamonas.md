## Backstory

Governor of Halfyord in service to the lord, of whom she is a cousin, Kamonas governs Halfyord with its commercial value and revenue stream has her priority.

Being a relative of the local lord has meant Kamonas has seen many different appointments in her lifetime, being moved around as the political whims and operational necessities dictate.
Her noble background afforded her excellent schooling when growing up, as well as experience in navigating the political intrigues of the upper classes.
She has shown she has an aptitude for governance, though the more day-to-day operations such as tax collection or troop inspection have not been suited to her wheelhouse.

Being a relatively important player on the political stage, Kamonas has seen her share of the more underhand tactics that the game encompasses.
These experiences are what gave her a respect for people like Shufharz, who despite being subordinates know their trade - and are suited to it - very well.
When Kamonas was appointed governor of Halfyord almost 2 years ago, replacing the former corrupt governor and appointing Shufharz - her previous bodyguard - as captain of the newly formed town guard.

## Appearance & Personality

Kamonas dresses in fine silks of purple and gold colouration.
She carries no discernable weapons, but the rings on her hands give off faint auras of protection magic.

For an elf, she is fairly short, only standing 5"4' tall, though she is seated for most of the day which can otherwise mask her actual height.
Her face is immaculate, and her hair styled into an almost showy display of flowing hair.

Kamonas is used to giving instructions and having them be carried out.
Being a politician, she is good at public speaking and projecting her voice - and avoiding giving answers to awkward questions should the need arise.
Towards subordinates her tone can be borderline authoritarian, however towards those she's since gotten to know this does ease off slightly.

Kamonas is fully committed to seeing Halfyord prosper as a commercial town.
Kamonas does not revel in politics, but is more than capable of navigating political intrigue can balancing the vested interests of Halfyord's nobility.
She is not cold hearted towards the lower classes, but she knows that she is ultimately judged by the tax haul that the town provides to the lord and the rapport she builds with the upper classes than public happiness.
It is this kind of motivation that has lead her to trust Shufharz with the day-to-day law and order of the town, hoping the relatively large garrison the town sports will protect the merchant trade the town depends on, whilst also showing the citizens that their leaders are committed to their safety.

## Relations

- Shufharz: Shufharz and Kamonas are as close to friends as their relative occupations will allow. There is a deep, mutual respect between the two of them, even if they might have their disagreements.
- Faire: Kamonas does not have such a negative opinion of Faire as the other council members and Shufharz, but only because she has experience dealing with people of his ilk in the past. She has identified him as largely incompetent, but nonetheless puts up with him due to the ramifications their falling out would have with the Ordo Magicae. Kamonas is usually the only person at council meetings who does not show any outward signs of annoyance at Faire - not that he is able to pick up on these signs from anyone else.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

- Kamonas can provide extensive details on the Piranhas past activities in Halfyord, how they were stopped, and their more recent activities.
  - She can discuss the corruption that was present in the old nobility.
  - She will share the fact that Carlton was never apprehended, nor the main hideout located.
  - She can also give details on the recent attempt on the town treasury.
- Kamonas knows about the planned [reverse heist](FIXME), but cannot give details in the same way Shufharz can.
- Kamonas can direct the party to the higher-end businesses, services, and stores within Halfyord.
- Kamonas will confirm that on the day Faire reportedly disappeared, he did not show up at the city council meeting, which was out of character for him.
