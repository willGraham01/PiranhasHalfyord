# Milena Kamonas

## Backstory

Governor of Halyford in service to the local lord, Kamonas governs Halfyord with its commercial value and revenue stream has her priority.
This does not mean she is cold hearted towards its citizens, but she knows that she is ultimately judged by the tax haul that the town provides to the lord rather than public happiness.

Kamonas herself is a distant cousin to the lord, although had displayed a talent for administrative duties prior to her appointment.
She received excellent schooling when growing up, as befits a minor nobility.

## Appearance & Personality

Kamonas dresses in fine silks of purple and gold colouration.
For an human, she is fairly short, only standing 5"4' tall, though she is seated for most of the day which can otherwise mask her actual height.
Her face is immaculate, and her hair styled into an almost showy display of flowing hair.
She carries no discernable weapons, but the rings on her hands give off faint auras of protection magic.

Kamonas is used to giving instructions and having them be carried out.
Being a politician, she is good at public speaking and projecting her voice - and avoiding giving answers to awkward questions should the need arise.
Towards subordinates her tone can be borderline authoritarian, however towards those she's since gotten to know this does ease off slightly.

Kamonas is fully committed to seeing Halfyord prosper as a commercial town, albeit only because her job, wealth, and station are preserved by it.
Were she to be reassigned, she would finalise the affairs of the town but then promptly be ambivalent to everything else concerning it.
It is this kind of motivation that lead her to instruct Shufharz to deal with the Piranhas gang in the first place, for example, and for the relatively large garrison the town sports - protecting the merchant trade is the lifeblood the town survives on.

## Relations

Kamonas' only notable relation is to Shufharz, who she still sees as a subordinate but as near to a friend as is possible in such a relationship.
She has had a number of interactions with Faire in his role as Ordinator and knows how to identify another "professional bullshitter" when she sees one, but nonetheless puts up with him due to his station.
