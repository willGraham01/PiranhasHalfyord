## Backstory

Faire Ron-Ron's ambitious and resentful apprentice.
Of course, Groubun quickly came to realise that Faire had since lost the skills that his reputation afforded him.

Groubun was born to upper-middle class parents with probably too much ambition for their children.
He is one of 4 siblings, all of which have been pushed to strive for rapid advancement and career progression in their respective fields.
Whilst Groubun has always had an interest in studying the magical arts, it is this background pressure that contributed to his joining the Ordo Magicae to pursue his studies, and later into picking the famous Faire Ron-Ron as his supervisor.

Groubun has a natural aptitude for imbuing mundane objects with magical properties, and has contributed to a number of advancements in the fields of alchemy and artifice.
Sadly, his decision to work with Faire was informed more by reputation than knowledge of what Faire was like to work with, which has resulted in Groubun's career stagnating as his work is constantly attributed to his supervisor.
He now faces a lot of pressure from his parents to "keep up" with his siblings, as they see Groubun's position in Halfyord as not being important enough to bring prestige (as he is not in charge of the guildhall) but also not advancing his career prospects (as he is stuck there with Faire taking credit for large portions of his work).

Groubun has been the brains behind most of Faire's recent contributions to magical advancement, however Faire's association as his supervisor and reputation in the wider community mean that Groubun's name is often overlooked.
He has also witnessed Faire's incompetence in his role as Ordinator, continuing to head up futile experiments and shove his Ordinator duties onto Jenessa.
This his gradually built up during his time in Halfyord into resentment.
It was these factors, plus the pressure from his family back home, that drove Groubun to speak his troubles at the local taverns and happened to catch the attention of Fordem.

## Appearance & Personality

Normally Groubun wears a set of artificer's goggles on his head, over his eyes, or around his neck - even when not working.
His attire includes practical clothes that have few trailing straps or pieces of cloth, sporting a belt with a wide range of tools attached at the waist alongside a pair of thick welding gloves.
He is also typically seen with a satchel bag slung over one shoulder.

Groubun is a mountain dwarf, standing around 4"6' with a solid-built frame.
He sports a long, black beard that reaches down his neck and is braided at the tip, but is otherwise bald.
His eyes are a cold blue, deep set into an almost chubby face.

He speaks with in a gruff tone, in a very precise manner.
His tone is not dismissive or derogatory, and he can be very open around people he knows, or when intoxicated.

However, Groubun gets annoyed when people say they understand a concept but later fail to demonstrate "common knowledge" about it.
He will later attempt to help them understand should they ask, and he believe their intentions are good.
Conversely, he enjoys it when people are upfront about not knowing anything about something, and actively ask him about something he knows a lot about.
He enjoys discussing research ideas, and has an aptitude for running the Ordo despite the appearance he puts up of it taking a toll on his research.

## Relations

- Jenessa: Groubun gets along well with Jenessa. His elevation to acting Ordinator has improved this further because he is now doing the aspects of Faire's job that Jenessa was picking up.
- Faire: To Faire, Groubun keeps up the illusion of an enthusiastic student but has begun to withhold information about his latest experiments and the like. Groubun secretly resents his position as Faire's apprentice.
- Fordem: Groubun initially thought of Fordem as a friendly barkeep, trying to keep his patrons happy to encourage them to come back. To an extent, this was working on Groubun. But now Groubun views their relationship as very much transactional. The two still put on a convincing display when he arrives at the Day's Rest with information or supplies though.
- Carlton: Groubun views Carlton as at best a means to an end, and at worst a necessary evil. Part of Groubun cannot wait for their arrangement to end.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

Being the one of the main perpetrators, Groubun has a lot of information that would be of use to the party.
But he is unlikely to share a lot of it.

- Groubun knows the true events that lead to Faire's disappearance:
  - Both him and Faire were working in the lab around noon, when Jenessa left for the Herbalist.
  - Groubun slipped a potion of polymorph into Faire's coffee, which it didn't take long for him to drink.
  - After Faire's transformation, Groubun quickly scooped up the confused Faire into a cage, and transported him to the Day's Rest with the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md).
  - Groubun met Fordem and Carlton in the hideout, where they put the collar on Faire, who was now [Whiskers](../characters/whiskers.md).
- Groubun also has his own version of events that lead to Faire's disappearance:
  - Both him and Faire were working in the lab around noon, when Jenessa left for the Herbalist.
  - Faire excused himself for a council meeting, and Groubun retired upstairs to work on a manuscript.
  - Groubun later learned that Faire never made it to the council meeting.
- Groubun does not know why Whiskers is now free to wander around the Day's Rest, rather than being locked in the hideout, but Fordem has told him it was because of an accident that let the cat escape, and be found by Hope.
- Groubun knows how the Collar of Confining works, and has the key to it in his room.
- Groubun will not share his career ambitions, nor his familial pressure, with the party nor even others in the Ordo.
- Groubun has extensive knowledge about potions and imbuing items with magic.
  - He may give falsified answers if asked about the potions or items he knows he has manufactured for the Piranhas, though.
