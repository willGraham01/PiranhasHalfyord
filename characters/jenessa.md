# Jenessa

## Backstory

Long-time member of the Ordo Magicae, acolyte Jenessa has always been content with her public-facing shopkeeper role at the outpost.

Jenessa joined the Ordo in her early 30s, not because she was exceptionally gifted with magic, or even because she had a budding interest in the arcane.
She wanted to travel the world and meet new people, and the best opportunity for her to do so without the backing of extensive wealth was to sign up with caravans or offer her services as a deliveryman.
As she racked up journeys and continued to visit new locations, she developed a knack for talking to people and bartering goods.

Jenessa would eventually be promoted to a permanent position within the Ordo after successfully negotiating a trade deal for rare ingredients during one of her trips to Halfyord.
Fiare's predecessor acknowledged her skill in sourcing goods and bartering, requested she join the permanent staff at the outpost.
For Jenessa, the busy town is not a terrible place to be trapped - there is a constant flow of new and interesting people moving through the town, and as the shopkeeper for the Ordo she often finds opportunities to talk with adventuring parties that pass through.
She has also ascended to a de-factor senior role at the outpost; whilst not superior in rank, her extensive years of experience and generally upbeat nature make her popular in the Ordo and the town itself.

## Appearance & Personality

Jenessa wears robes that bear the sigil of the Ordo, though less grandeur and showy than those Fiare wears as Ordinator.
Her hair is completely white, almost blending into her pale skin at times.
She is approximately 3" tall with blue eyes, and a rounded but wrinkled face that most of the time bears a warm smile.

Jenessa is quite outgoing and always up for a conversation with interesting people.
When things get down to business however, she's no pushover.
She is also reluctant to share her negative opinions of other people.

Jenessa is quite content with her permanent position at the Ordo.
Though as she gets older, she does hold out hope for one final trip before she's too old to go out into the world.

## Relations

Jenessa has always got along with Groubun, and recently her opinion of him has improved as he is taking the Ordinator role seriously, unlike Faire.
On the other hand, she is quite bitter about Faire's appointment to the outpost and scornful of how he treats others and has an inflated opinion of himself - though she would never share such things freely.
Jenessa has a cordial relationship with Shufharz - the two have exchanged information when Shufharz has required it for investigations, and Jenessa has also been able to flag to Shufharz when unusual goods are moving through the town.
It is for this reason that she is in the loop about the upcoming "reverse heist" and Groubun is not.
