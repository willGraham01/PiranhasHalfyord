## At a Glance

## Backstory

A high-ranking member of the Piranhas, who poses as the bartender of the Day's Rest tavern.

Fordem was born into crime, the only son of two thieves, and has never known anything else.
Unlike most other members of the Piranhas gang though, Fordem has never served jail time since arriving in Halfyord nearly 20 years ago.
He has also never had any desire to reach the top of the gang's leadership pile, carving a niche for himself as a loyal henchman who also commands a moderate amount of respect from the lower members of the gang.

Fordem has been an ally of Carlton pretty much since the Piranhas formed.
He helped Carlton climbing the ranks of the gang, knowing that if Carlton was successful then he would reap some reward once the dust settled.
Fordem also knew that it was better to back a rising star like Carlton before Fordem's own influence over the lower members of the gang - and age - began to draw the ire of the current leaders.

Fordem himself is a career criminal at around 40 years old, but appreciates that nowadays it is his social skills and criminal insights that keep him useful to the gang.
It was Fordem's idea to purchase the Day's Rest Tavern by largely legal means when the gang's fortunes began to slip, and his social charm that enabled the gang to enter into their agreement with Groubun, after all.
He remains loyal to Carlton, and backs Shark's plan to escape from Halfyord if the offer presents itself.

Fordem runs the Day's Rest front and serves as the first line of defence to the hideout, and the frontman for members returning from jobs or seeking a safehouse.
His skills in smuggling, and age, are largely why he is in this role - he (and the rest of the gang) know he is less useful in the field than he once was.
Fordem is still as capable as the average gang member in a fight though, but tires of his persona as the friendly barkeeper.

## Appearance & Personality

Fordem wears a golden tooth necklace like Carlton to indicate his rank, but also has a gang tattoo on his right breast.
He wears barkeep's clothes; a loose fitting shirt with lacing across the front, a belt with various cloths and a keyring attached, and practical shoes that can withstand the floor of a busy pub and secret hideout.
Whilst he is not visibly armed, he keeps a dagger on his back leg when working the front, and if encountered in the hideout will have his scimitar to hand and ready to use.

Fordem is 6"1, with what was likely an athletic build that has since started to wither away.
He is still active and by no means fat, but not as sprity looking as he might have been a few years ago.
His face is beginning to show his age too; there are a few grey hairs in his mid-length hairstyle, and his face is starting to wrinkle around the mouth and eyes.

Fordem keeps up a friendly attitude when running the Day's Rest as a front, though knows how to disguise his words when speaking with known accomplices.
Within the gang's ranks he speaks with both authority and something of a mentor's tone, and to Carlton he speaks as an equal.
He speaks to Hope as one would expect a manager to speak to an employee, though this is not done in a derogatory but more of a teaching manner.

Fordem's mindset is not dissimilar to Carlton's - he believes that if he can get away with crime and reap the benefits, it is worth the ill gotten gains.
He also knows to value his own self-preservation though, and backs Carlton's plans to relocate the group once the bargain with Groubun is complete and Faire framed.

## Relations

- Carlton: Fordem sees Carlton as a mixture of a friend, leader, and student, due to his unique position within the gang's ranks. His loyalty still firmly lies with Carlton, and his plan to relocate the gang away from Halfyord.
- Shufharz: Fordem does not know Shufharz personlly, but respects her intelligence and strategic thinking.
- Groubun: Groubun is mostly an accomplice in Fordem's eyes, but he knows he needs to keep up the pretence of being Groubun's friend, mostly to settle the dwarf's nerves whenever he comes to pay the gang a visit.
- Hope: An employee. Fordem keeps up his barkeep appearances by adopting a kind of apprentice / supervisor relationship with Hope.
- Faire: Now Whiskers the cat, Fordem only keeps Faire as the tavern pet because he escaped from the hideout one time and Hope found him wandering around the tavern.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

- Fordem knows a great deal everything about Faire's disappearance, the magical attacks, and the Piranhas gang that the party might need in the adventure. Though he does not know quite as much as Carlton.
  - He knows the terms of the deal with Groubun.
  - He knows Faire is Whiskers. He also knows the antidote that Groubun will administer will wipe Faire's memory of being a cat.
  - He knows the eventual plan is to escape Halfyord and re-establish the gang elsewhere.
- Fordem carries one of two keys needed to unlock the Piranhas vault.
  - Fordem knows that there is a passage through the sewers that leads into the Piranhas vault.
- Fordem knows the plan of attack for the attack on the docks.
  - Fordem knows that a number of gang members are staying in the Day's Rest in preparation for the heist in the morning.

## Statblock

Fordem will likely be part of the final encounter, fighting alongside Carlton.
He is slightly more resilient and hits a bit harder than the average gang member, but there is nothing else particularly special about him.
