# Fordem

## Backstory

A high-ranking member of the Shattered Teeth, who poses as the bartender of the Day's Rest tavern.
Fordem has been an ally of Carlton every since he begun climbing the ranks of the gang.
Fordem himself is a career criminal at around 40 years old, but appreciates that nowadays it is his social skills and criminal insights that keep him useful to the gang.
He continues to stick by Carlton as leader, though is in on the Shark's plan to escape from Halfyord if the offer presents itself.

Fordem runs the Day's Rest front and serves as the first line of defence to the hideout, and the frontman for members returning from jobs or seeking a safehouse.
His skills in smuggling, and age, are largely why he is in this role - he (and the rest of the gang) know he is less useful in the field but very useful for logistics.
Fordem is still as capable as the average gang member in a fight though, but has grown fond of his persona as the friendly barkeeper.

## Appearance & Personality

Fordem is 6"1, with what was likely an athletic build that has since started to wither away - he is still active and by no means fat, but not as sprity looking as he might have been a few years ago.
His face is beginning to show his age too; there are a few grey hairs in his mid-length hairstyle, and his face is starting to wrinkle around the mouth and eyes.

He wears a golden tooth necklace like Carlton to indicate his rank, but also has a gang tattoo on his right breast.
He wears barkeep's clothes; a loose fitting shirt with lacing across the front, a belt with various cloths and a keyring attached, and practical shoes that can withstand the floor of a busy pub and secret hideout.
Whilst he is not visibly armed, he keeps a dagger on his back leg when working the front, and if encountered in the hideout will have his scimitar to hand and ready to use.

Fordem keeps up a friendly attitude when running the Day's Rest as a front, though knows how to disguise his words when speaking with known accomplice.
Within the gang's ranks, he speaks with both authority and something of a mentor's tone.
To Carlton, he speaks as an equal.

Fordem's mindset is not dissimilar to Carlton's - he believes that if he can get away with crime and reap the benefits, it is worth the ill gotten gains.
He also knows to value his own self-preservation though, and backs Carlton's plans to relocate the group once the bargain with Groubun is complete and Faire framed.

## Relations

Fordem sees Carlton as a mixture of a friend, leader, and student, due to his unique position within the gang's ranks.
He knows to respect Shufharz's intelligence and strategic thinking, and is almost admirable of her abilities in suppressing the gang's abilities of late.
Groubun is an accomplice but Fordem knows he has to keep up the pretence of being his friend, mostly to settle the dwarf's nerves whenever he comes to pay the gang a visit.
Hope is simply an employee - when the gang "acquired" the pub

## Stat Block

Fordem uses the standard shattered teeth gang member stat block, but drops his gold necklace rather than a silver one that a regular gang member does.
He can also take *uncanny dodge* as a reaction (halve the damage from any attack from a creature he can see).
