## At a Glance

- Race: Half-Orc
- Age: 34
- Gender: Female (she/her)
- Occupation: Captain of the Halfyord Guard

## Backstory

Shufharz has been a career soldier all her life.
Born into a poor household with nothing to their name, Shufharz quickly learnt that to get anywhere requires a lot of determination and effort.
She started working in her early teens, joining her father in the mines and putting her Orcish heritage to good use.
At 18, she enlisted with the local garrison with the support of her parents, all of them hoping it would be a chance for her to advance out of the social status she was born into.

Shufharz showed promise during her military training, and her no-nonsense attitude towards putting effort in to overcome obstacles did not go unnoticed by her superiors.
After some routine postings in the local garrisons, she was promoted into the standing army as a footsoldier, and later rose to an officer rank, serving in the standing military until her late twenties.
It was during these years of service as an officer that she was assigned as a personal guard to Milena Kamonas, a close relative of the local lord or Halfyord.
Kamonas appreciated Shufharz' no-nonsense attitude but also willingness to challenge authority when there was reason to, and in turn Shufharz appreciated that Kamonas was open to taking Shufharz' council when lacking her own expertise in military and defence affairs.

When Kamonas was assigned as governor of Halfyord, she insisted Shufharz be made captain of the guard.
Shufharz is largely responsible for dismantling the Piranhas's grip on Halford two years ago, after a methodical campaign lasting just under six months.

## Appearance & Personality

Shufharz carries a warhammer and wears chain mail carrying emblems of the city of Halfyord, with insignia not unlike the rest of the garrison.
She does not wear a cloak, but has a scarf with a golden chain around her neck and shoulders as a symbol of her rank.
Her outfit is rounded out by military issue boots, with sturdy leather bracers and greaves covering her forearms and shins.

Shufharz stands 6"5' tall, with a muscular build and dark green skin.
Her hair is jet black and of a middling length, but is normally tied into a practical ponytail so it doesn't get in her face during combat.
Short tusks protrude from either corner of her mouth, and her face carries a number of small scratches and scars that have never fully healed.
Her eyes are narrow with red pupils.

She speaks precisely and with authority, but generally has people's best interests at heart and will not stop a well-intended subordinate from challenging their orders.
There is a distinctive shift in her tone and pattern of speech when switching between a work and social context, even if the people involved in the conversation do not change.

Shufharz values honesty and duty, affording these things to her superiors whilst also demanding them of her subordinates.
She also believes in leading by example, and often joins in patrols and other activities that might be left to the lower footsoldiers.
Her commitment to carrying out a task typically wins in a conflict of interest, and she has been known to slip into an "ends justify the means" mentality at times, because of this.

## Relations

- Kamonas: Shufharz and Kamonas are as close to friends as their relative occupations will allow. There is a deep, mutual respect between the two of them, even if they might have their disagreements.
- Faire: Shufharz has not had much interaction or care for the staff at the Ordo Magicae, but has little time for Faire at council meetings due to the clash of their two personalities.
- Groubun: Groubun and Shufharz have only met once, since he took on his new role as acting Ordinator.
- Jenessa: Shufharz knows Jenessa as the Ordo Magicae's shop clerk, but also goes through her occasionally when outfitting the guard or an investigation requires a substance identified. She notes that Jenessa has been particularly helpful both with past and present investigations.
- Shark Carlton: Shufharz is naturally disliking of the Piranhas in general, and sees apprehending Carlton as both a long-overdue duty and slight personal vendetta. Despite this, knows that Carlton is not to be underestimated and is very resourceful.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

- Shufharz can provide extensive details on the Piranhas past activities in Halfyord, how they were stopped, and their more recent activities.
  - She can discuss the corruption that was present in the old nobility.
  - She can discuss the methodology that was undertaken during her 6-month campaign against the gang.
  - She will share the fact that Carlton was never apprehended, nor the main hideout located.
  - She can also give details on the recent attempt on the town treasury.
- Shufharz can provide full details about the planned [reverse heist](FIXME), and ensure that party members can be disguised in certain roles.
- Shufharz can direct the party to relevant businesses, services, and stores within Halfyord. For example, the blacksmith or herbalist if needing weapons or medical supplies.
- Shufharz knows that Piranhas gang members wear silver / gold tooth necklaces, and will identify them as such if shown one.
- Shufharz' poor relationship with Faire will initially give her the predisposition that he is now willingly involved with the gang's activities, seeing it as a case of an unpopular egotist trying to prove a point.
