# Shark Carlton

## At a Glance

- Race: Human
- Age: Early 30s
- Gender: Male (he/him)
- Occupation: Leader of the Piranhas gang

## Backstory

Leader of the Piranhas through his combination of cunning, guile, and ruthlessness.
Carlton was a street urchin growing up, and quickly fell into circles that lead him into a professional crime career.
He had served jail time for petty crimes in several cities before his 20th birthday, at which point his life took him to Halfyord.
Here he made contact with one of the smaller criminal gangs that would eventually merge with the other gangs in the town to form the Piranhas.

Carlton slowly rose to prominence within the gang over the course of the following 10-ish years.
When his gang merged with the others to form the Piranhas, Carlton was still several rungs below the top.
However it was during this time that he first began to work with Fordem Chev, with the more veteran criminal helping Carlton acquaint himself with the politics of gang leadership.
Carlton would go on to make power plays against the other leaders of the Piranhas, or capitalise on their untimely demise or arrests, to take the leadership position - with Fordem becoming a close right-hand man.

Carlton is largely responsible for orchestrating the Piranha's "golden age" two years ago.
The appointment of Kamonas and Shufharz would change this; the newly reformed town guard and the removal of corrupt officials, alongside an aggressive streak of raids on suspected Piranhas hideouts was too much for the gang to adjust to.
Carlton also knew that the loyalty of most of the gang members was bought through their share of the spoils, which is partly why he finds himself in the position he's in now.

Carlton now finds himself under de-facto house arrest in the Piranhas main headquarters / hideout, orchestrating minor crimes with what remains of his gang.
The deal with Groubun serves as something of a hail mary; Carlton knows the gang's days are done, but reckons they can take enough from the town in the next few months to re-establish the gang somewhere else.

## Appearance & Personality

Carlton wears a golden tooth necklace - similar to the silver equivalents worn by the lower-ranking Piranhas members - at all times.
His face has an old, long scar down one cheek, and his jaw is quite pointed.
Long brown hair is often tied up into a ponytail, and covered by a bandana that is tied over the top of his head.
His eyes offer an intense, piercing stare.

Carlton's clothes are practical civilian garbs often worn by dock workers or sailors, covered by leathers that serve as armour.
Despite rarely leaving the hideout nowadays, he continues to dress as if ready to spring into action.
His boots have a dagger strapped along the ankle, and a scimitar sheathed hangs around his waist.
On his belt is a pouch of musket pellets, and two flintlock pistols are holstered across the front of his chest.
He wears a [Carlton's ring](#bonus-actions) - supplied by Groubun - on one hand.

Carlton speaks to gang members and subordinates with authority, conviction, and precision.
Carlton typically adopts a sarcastic - almost derogatory - tone that is laced with a sense of urgency or boredom.
This tone is less derogatory towards members of the gang he has come to respect - out of loyalty or ambition - such as Fordem.

Carlton values the luxuries of life and the thrill that comes from orchestrating the crimes that support it.
He sees crime as the easiest method of sustaining such a lifestyle, and the natural progression of the strong being able to take what they want from the weak.
However, above all else Carlton values self-preservation and survival - even to the point of betrayal.

## Relations

- Fordem: Carlton sees Fordem as the closest thing to a friend that a criminal gang can foster. He respects the ageing gang member as an advisor and a former mentor, and has made Fordem his right-hand man.
- Shufharz: Carlton despises Shufharz for obvious reasons, though recognises her as an adversary not to be underestimated.
- Groubun: Groubun is more of a useful accomplice than a friend, and Carlton won't hesitate to throw them under the bus in self-preservation. Their deal is very much a means to an end for both parties, and a somewhat tenuous one at that.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

- Carlton obviously knows everything about Faire's disappearance, the magical attacks, and the Piranhas gang that the party might need in the adventure.
  - He knows the terms of the deal with Groubun.
  - He knows Faire is currently a cat, being kept by Fordem. He also knows the antidote that Groubun will administer will wipe Faire's memory of being a cat.
  - He knows that Groubun keeps a key to the magical collar at the Ordo Magicae.
  - He knows the eventual plan is to escape Halfyord and re-establish the gang elsewhere.
- Carlton carries one of two keys needed to unlock the Piranhas vault.
