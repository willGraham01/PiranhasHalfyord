title: Whiskers

## At a Glance

- Race: Cat
- Age: Just under 1 month
- Gender: Male (he/him)
- Occupation: Tavern Cat at the Day's Rest.

## Backstory

Whiskers is the transformed [Faire Ron-Ron](./faire-ron-ron.md), who is now confined to a life as a tavern pet.

Trivia: "ronron" means *to purr* in French.

## Appearance & Personality

Whiskers has almost completely gray fur (of an identical colour to Faire's hair) with patches of white near his feet, ears, and nose.
He does not move with the usual dexterity and grace of a cat, as he is not used to being in this form.

His mannerisms around people also reflect those of a human more than a cat:

- He will follow conversations with his head (rather than being ambivalent like a cat usually would).
- He can react to (and follow if he chooses) instructions that people give him (since he understands Common and other languages).
- He understands that doors can be opened by moving the handles, rather than waiting to be let through them.
- He does not show a lot of joy in being fed cat food.
- He takes himself to the outhouse / bathroom  when nature calls.

He is unable to talk, cast or be affected by spells, or indeed willingly leave the tavern by virtue of the [Confining Collar](../items/confining-collar.md) that he is wearing.

## Relations

Whiskers' relationships are the same as Faire's.

## Plot Relevant Knowledge

Same as Faire's, though his experiences as a cat will be forgotten if he is administered [Groubun's antidote](../items/potion-of-corporeal-resetting.md).

## Statblock

Whiskers uses the cat stat block, as found in the Player's Handbook.
