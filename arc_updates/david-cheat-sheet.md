# Quick Reference Guide

You have a lot of spells & options, because you're a Druid!
Thought I'd put them into a quick cheat-sheet for you.

## Out of Combat

You have a lot of spells & abilities that are useful outside of combat.

- Wild Shape: turn into a small animal like a dog or cat.
- Guidance: help a friend in something they're about to do.
- Mold Earth / Mending: manipulate the material world.
- Create or Destroy Water: in case you need it.
- Jump: get to places you couldn't otherwise.
- Find Familiar / Speak with Animals: if you want a (temporary) pet.
- Pass Without Trace: make everyone very sneaky.

## In Combat

Remember; in combat on your turn, you get

- 1 action,
- 1 bonus action,
- To move (30 ft / 6 squares on a grid),

and you can do them in any order you like.
You can also split up your movement too.
You can't cast 2 spells on one turn, unless one of them is a cantrip (free spell).

I've written down a list of the "common" options in combat, but don't be afraid to improvise!

### Actions

#### Damage

- Breath weapon (breathe lightning since you're a dragonborn). Hits multiple enemies.
- Thorn Whip. Hits a nearby enemy and might make them unable to run away.
- Ray of Frost. Hits an enemy at range & slows them down next turn.

#### More Damage?

- Thunderwave. Hits multiple enemies
- Moonbeam. Hits multiple enemies
- Spike Growth. Damages & slows enemies that enter a certain area.

#### Other Options

- Cure Wounds. Help an ally (or yourself) get some health back.
- Hold Person. Stop a _person_ from running away.
- Fog Cloud. Cover an area in mist.

### Bonus Actions

Druids don't have many bonus actions, but you can Wild Shape (turn into an animal) as a bonus action.

I wouldn't recommend it in combat though, unless you want to become a wolf to chase / track someone down.
