# Setting

This section describes the town of Halfyord, where the adventure was originally intended to take place.
The town is deliberately designed to be somewhat self-contained, to allow the adventure to be "insertable" into larger games or longer-running campaigns, and some aspects of teh descriptions below are left deliberately vague.
In particular, there is deliberately no mention of the state or wider governing body that Halfyord belongs to, the major settlements that it trades with or is situated between, and the details about the Ordo Magicae are deliberately limited just to the organisational structure within the town's guildhall itself.

DMs should feel free to expand on the descriptions given here, or adapt them as necessary to suit their needs or personal campaigns and games.
A more detailed discussion of the core mechanics that the story depends on, and how to change the appearance of the adventure without changing the underlying store is given in the [customising the adventure](FIXME) section.

Some locations within Halfyord have detailed descriptions and floorplans, since the party is expected to explore and interact with these environments in depth during the story.
These locations are given a short summary in the [following section](#halfyord), and are further elaborated on in the [mapped locations](FIXME) section, and sample floor-plans are provided for online TTRPG tools.

## Halfyord

Halfyord is a prosperous town that straddles both sides of the river Hal, which runs north to south through the town and split it into two (referred to as the east and west bank).
The town started off as a small fishing town that ran a ferry commissions for travellers looking to cross the banks of the Hal.
Over time, the town grew in importance and size as the number of travellers increased and the surrounding roads and trade routes began to develop.
This eventually lead to the construction of the bridge that joins both sides of the town, as well as the docks that facilitates maritime trade up and down the Hal river itself.
The town is now walled on both sides of the river, though there are no lock-gates on the river itself.
The main road that leads from the east gate to the bridge, then on past the market square and to the west gate, is the widest road in the town and is always in pristine condition and well-lit by lampposts.
The surrounding countryside is used for farming and subsidence agriculture, and houses a number of hamlets and farmsteads that fall under the town's administration.

The population of Halfyord is diverse; humans make up the most common species and the original settlers, but nowadays elves and dwarves also make up a sizeable chunk of the population.
The town has a local governor (magistrate) and a number of the wealthier merchants sit on the town council, though ultimately the town is still ruled over - and pays taxes to - a Lord whose capital is elsewhere.
The demeanour of the residents is open and welcoming to the untrained eye, but the merchants are professionals with profit foremost in mind, which has lead most of the lower-class citizens to be weary of being taken for a fool.

Many of the lower-class citizens are dock workers, or work in one of the various taverns and boarding houses that are sustained by the travelling merchants.
Most of these residents will reside on the east bank, which is predominantly composed of permanent housing and small street markets offering food, clothing, and other essential materials for everyday life.
The streets are narrower and "more lively" at night than on the west bank, but are by no means in dire disrepair.

The wealthier citizens typically reside on the west bank, in slightly grander detached houses compared to the terraced houses that make up the majority of the east bank.
The elite live in mansion houses that line the main street running from the market square to the magistrates office.
All businesses that are based in the town and have a permanent premises are found on this side of the river too.

FIXME: places that are very plot relevant, need maps or descriptions should have their own pages w/ links to resources if available. EG ordo magicae needs ot have the lab and upper floors described!

FIXME: move descriptions from events and scenes into these sections, for streamlining. Explain this at top of this section or in the how to read section.

### The Docks

Situated on the west bank of the river are the docks, with the commercial docks being separated from the merchant docks by the bridge.
A small underpass runs underneath the bridge that links the two areas of the docks.
The docks are generally safe all times, with city watch members patrolling at all times of day - though with a reduced presence at night.

The commercial docks to the south of the bridge still run ferry services across the Hal, as well as recreational trips or fishing expeditions.
Ferry services also run along the river to the settlements up and downstream from Halfyord.
The wealthier members of Halfyord's society also dock private vessels here.
It typically sees a lot of activity in the early mornings and late afternoons of the working days, as citizens of the city need to commute to and from work.

The merchant docks to the north of the bridge see a large amount of activity, seeing a large number of goods passing through in both directions each week.
Large warehouses line the docks and back onto the town streets behind, with cranes and other lifting machinery being present at a number of docking stations along the bank.

The portion of the docks that the party will be concerned with the mooring station in the commercial side of the docks, closest to the town bridge, which is where they will [scout in the evening](./scenes/04-scouting-the-docks.md) and then be present for [the plant the following day](./scenes/06-planted-cargo.md).
A winding, sloped road runs across the bridge and then splits at a junction, with one of these split roads running parallel to the mooring station and serving as an access road to the commercial docks with various slip-roads that break off to the various mooring stations.
The bridge is approximately 50ft higher than the docks platform, with the mooring stations being closer to the water still to allow ships to dock at them.
There is also a spiral staircase that descends from the bridge itself to the docks, exiting out onto the docks platform near the docking crane and the bridge underpass.

Nestled in the square-like area that the road wraps around is the docking crane and various containers and crates that are presumably used for loading.
This area sits on a raised platform approximately 1m above the docks, with a small access ramp providing access from the docking platform.
The crane itself sits on a turntable, and is operated by a series of levers, winches, and pulleys - there is usually a dedicated team of dockworkers coordinating this operation.
A small, square platform is attached to the arm of the crane which is used for loading and unloading ships - the reach of this arm extends comfortably over the mooring station.
On the map, the crane is only represented by its turntable, in the upper-left corner.

The docking platform itself has the river on one side and is lined with a series of warehouses, crane platforms, and mooring stations.
Of concern to the adventure is the warehouse & mooring station closest to the town bridge.
The mooring station consists of a straight platform like one might see on a canal, with hitching posts that boats can attach to.
It sits slightly closer to the water level of the river than the main docks platform, again accessed via a short ramp which is approximately 60-100ft from the bridge underpass.
The mooring station itself has nothing remarkable about it, whilst the warehouse is a two-story building that can be accessed from the docking platform via a double doorway, and has a single window with shutters that also faces out over the docking platform on the upper floor.
Inside the warehouse is a massive supply of empty boxes and crates, covered with tarpaulins, which have been pushed to the back and sides of the warehouse floor.
There is a small workstation in the back right corner of the ground floor that looks to house various repair and woodworking tools for use during loading.
A staircase runs up the wall next to the workstation to get to the upper floor, which much like the lower floor contains a few empty crates and tarpaulins (though of a smaller size).

The segment of the docking platform that is used in the adventure extends approximately 150ft from the bridge underpass.

### The Great Market Square

On the west side of the river, visible from the docks, sits the Great Market Square.
It is open to the air, and centres on a statue of the town founder, atop a large fountain.
The square itself is approximately 500 ft on both sides, with markings on the ground indicating areas that should be left open as pathways, and other areas that can be occupied by merchants.

The great market square has no permanent stands, and traders have to wheel their own carts or stalls in to sell their wares.
Permission to trade in the square is often acquired when first entering the town or by visiting the magistrates office, and typically lasts the week.
The square is also typically where businesses will go to negotiate and finalise deals, or to source a supplier of goods who has setup a temporary stand.

Governor's Walk is the street that runs from the Great Market Square directly to the Magistrate's office and attached barracks.
The main road through town linking the west and east gate passes along the southern edge of the square.

### The Ordo Magicae Outpost

Halfyord is large enough to warrant a permanent outpost for the Ordo Magicae, located to the south of the Great Market Square.
It is a detached building, much like most of the buildings on the west bank, but is not as grand as a full guildhall.

The permanent staff consist of a fully qualified mage who runs the outpost, holding the title of Ordinator.
Their Apprentice is typically next in the chain of command, and the remaining staff are administrative or predominantly attendants to the Ordinator.

The ground floor hosts a shop front that offers access to basic off-the-shelf potions and mundane magical items, as well as services such as identification or enchantment commissions - though the latter is typically unaffordable except by the town elite or wealthy adventurers.
The ground floor is approximately a 75-by-75ft square in terms of floor space.
A shop desk is situated across the ground floor from the street entrance, in clear view so that whoever is behind the desk can see customers entering the shop.
There are a number of display tables, shelves, and cases on the shop floor, as well as bookcases containing journal articles by members of the guildhall, as well as more standard textbook like tomes for sale.
In the left-hand corner of the floor (after entering from the street) is a small waiting area that customers may wait in when they request specific magic items or services (like silvering or enchanting).
The "top right" corner of the floor is section off into it's own small room, accessible through a locked doorway.
This contains the stairway to the next floor, and is also a temporary storage location for tables and other display cases that are currently not in use on the main shop floor.

The first floor hosts a communal living space, rooms for the lower-ranking permanent staff members and visiting guild members, and the laboratory.
Entering the floor from the shop floor places a person in the communal living space, an approximately 50ft-by-40ft rectangular room ("wider" than it is "tall" when viewed from top-down).
Directly across the room from this staircase is another set of stairs leading to the top floor.
The communal space has a kitchenette-style area, are fireplace with some comfy looking chairs and rugs, and a more practical dining table.
There is also a notice board fixed to the long wall opposite the kitchenette area, that has various guild-related announcements and news articles pinned to it.
The communal space has a doorway to the lab in the opposite corner to the stairs from the shop floor, and a smaller doorway to the living quarters on the short wall opposite the staircases.

The communal space is actually just a narrow corridor that runs along the (opposite side of the) short wall of the communal space, with some small rooms that each open out into the corridor.
These rooms are for the lower-ranking members of the guild, and one is kept free for guests if any members of the Ordo are visiting.
They each have a bed, wardrobe and chest of draws, and a small side table for the bed.
There is also a restroom in the corridor.

The laboratory is primarily for members of the guild to conduct experiments in, and to use when manufacturing items commissioned through the store-front on the ground floor, but is also where the guild stores its alchemical reagents and magical components (such as gems).
It shares one of its walls with one of the long walls of the communal space, and almost has as much floor space.
In the centre of the lab is a single table that has multiple workstations, each with different pieces of kit setup for experiments.
Though it is intended that equipment not being used be put away in the cupboards and shelves that line the outer walls of the lab, in practice a lot of frequently-used equipment is left out on the main table.
The outer walls are designed to maximise storage, and are packed with shelves, bookcases, and cabinets - there are even some wires that have alchemical reagents hanging overhead and growing off them.
There are two desks in the far corners (from the entrance) that are used by the Ordinator and their Apprentice.
These desks typically contain experimental logbooks, draft manuscripts, and the remains of food or drink that can't be taken near the experiments.

The second (top) floor has rooms for the Ordinator and their Apprentice.
Accessing it from the staircase in the communal area of the floor below will place a person into a corridor that the two rooms open out onto, along with another restroom.

The two rooms on this floor are quarters for the Ordinator and their Apprentice, and have slightly nicer accommodations and more spacious layouts.
Each have a hearth, floor-to-ceiling wardrobe, separate chest of draws, and study desk.
The Ordinator's room also has some comfy armchairs and multiple bedside tables.

### The Magistrates Office and Barracks

The magistrates office is the public-facing courthouse, as well as the place of residence for the local governor.
It is built at the end of Governor's Walk, the main street leading directly to the Great Market Square and lined with mansion houses owned by the city elite, most of which are on the city council in some capacity.
It is a large building - most likely the largest in town - and has exquisite architectural features and is always immaculately decorated and clean.

Due to how the town grew from its humble origins, the barracks and jail form part of the same structure as the council chambers and governor's residence.
The main entrance now leads into a lobby and the council chambers (on the ground floor), with the governor's residence on the upper floor.
The barracks is mostly accessed through a side-entrance that is not visible from the front of the building, with the jail entirely underground beneath this part of the building.
The upper floors of the barracks home the city guard who do not own a residence inside the city, as well as providing modest quarters for the captain of the town guard.

### The Temple

Halfyord is home to an ecumenical temple to no particular deity, which is open to public worship and holds sermons on weekends.
It can be found on the eastern bank of the Hal, on the edge of the residential suburbs near the city wall.

The temple itself is more akin to a chapel, being barely taller than most houses on the east bank, though tall enough for its clock tower to be visible from the main street.
Beyond the chapel structure itself, there are some modest grounds which consist primarily of gardens that the clergy tend to, and some small buildings that function as a vicarage - the clergy lives there, and they can provide cramped if functional lodgings for pilgrims and visiting priests, paladins, and the like.
It is also the de-facto hospital for the town, and gets most of its herbal supplies from the herbalist store on the other side of the river, and occasionally potions or other healing substances from the Ordo Outpost.

The temple is funded mostly by donations from pilgrims on their way to holy sites of greater import, and the healing services it provides.

### The Day's Rest Tavern

The Day's Rest is one of several taverns that can be found on the east bank of Halfyord.
It's residents are typically locals from the surrounding suburbs, and it typically does not see much of the merchant traffic who typically stay either closer to the docks or on the west bank.

The building has guest lodgings on the first floor and a large meeting hall on the ground.
The meeting hall contains a hearth and the bar, which backs onto the kitchen.
There is a mezzanine level above the hearth for patrons, which leads to the guest rooms, and a private staircase behind the bar that leads to the owner's lodgings.
A door behind the bar leads down to the cellar and, unbeknownst to the public, leads to a secret hideout which is the base of the Piranhas gang.

The tavern and hideout are [split into two locations with separate maps](#mapped-locations), with the cellar door leading between the two.

#### The Piranhas' Hideout

FIXME write after tidying up copied content
The recreation room is rectangular, approximately twice as long as it is deep.
The cellar joins to it FIXME write the hideout layout into the setting or other place where descriptions are needed! Don't pollute the events.

Going through the wall will place the party in the gathering hall that the gang has underground.
This area will be well-lit and most likely populated by gang members, unless they were all apprehended at the docks.
There are two further exits on either side of the far side of the room, both with closed doors.
Immediately in front of the wall-door is a desk and a makeshift supply dump that the gang has been using for their magical items and potions.
There is a logbook on the desk which details which materials are assigned to who, for which heists or missions - note that the cargo heist today is listed as the last entry on the board.
The centre of the room is taken up by a recreation area - there are rugs and cushions to form a seating area, and a table with cards and games left out.
There is a notice board on the wall just beside the "games" table which has gang announcements of sorts.
In particular, there will be a "next delivery exchange" note which may incriminate Groubun.
The far end of the room has a table that's used as an eatery, and an unkempt bookshelf.

Taking the door at the far end of the room, on the same wall as that which leads to the cellar, will take the party to the lodgings.
There are several beds in here, a few weapon racks with various items missing or mislaid, some spare plain clothes in wardrobes, and a number of silver-tooth necklaces similar to those that the party might have recovered from gang members they've encountered before.

The door opposite to the lodgings is reinforced, and leads into a log corridor lit by scones.
At the end of the corridor there are two sets of doors facing each other.

### Other Locations of Import

Off in the side streets that lead away from the market, on the west side of the Hal, a number of permanent shops can be found.
These include all the usual amenities like a:

- Blacksmith,
- Stables,
- Carpenter,
- General goods store,
- Pawnbroker,
- Jewellers,
- Herbalist,

etc.

## Mapped Locations

Not all scenes in the story have a map provided, which is typically true of the locations where the party's interactions are (expected to be) limited to social interactions or investigations.
Areas of Halfyord that the party visits multiple times, or whose layout is useful to visualise (due to potential combat encounters, or spatial reasoning) are provided here for use.
They have been designed to try and be faithful to the descriptions of the areas given above, and should contain the necessary features that the scenes in the story refer to as holding clues or other sources of information for the party.

All maps give the number of 5ft-by-5ft squares that make up the map, and each map is given to a scale of 50px = one 5ft-by-5ft square.

These maps were made using [DungeonScrawl](https://www.dungeonscrawl.com/), if you want to tweak certain features of the map you can contact the maintainers and we can provide the corresponding `.ds` file.

- [The Great Market Square](./floorplans/market-50px-per-square-36x33.png), 36 (W) by 33 (H) squares. This map is meant to only represent one quarter of the market square, which is why some features abruptly end.
- [The Ordo Magicae Outpost](./floorplans/ordo-outpost-50px-per-square-34x59.png), 34 (W) by (59) squares. The map is divided into the 3 floors of the building, with the ground floor at the bottom of the map and the top floor at the top.
- [The Docks](./floorplans/docks-50px-per-square-75x48.png), 75 (W) by 48 (H) squares. This only represents the relevant docking station and it's connections to the main bridge over Halford. The bridge underpass is provided off to the left of the map as its own small area, since the bridge itself overlaps with the underpass when viewed from above.
- [The Day's Rest Tavern](./floorplans/days-rest-interior_31x33.png), 31 (W) by 33 (H) squares. A trapdoor is used to represent the cellar door entrance, though this could just as well be a regular door depending on the flavour you want to apply.
- [The Piranhas Hideout](./floorplans/hideout-50px-per-square-32x36.png) 32 (W) by (36) squares. The crack in the wall from Calton's room into the sewers is not represented.
