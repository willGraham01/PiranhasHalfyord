## Halfyord

Halfyord is a reasonably wealthy merchant town of provincial importance, straddling both sides (west & east) of the river Hal.
Its natural position as a crossing point and the slightly more recent dock have made it an important hub for trade and travellers.
The centre of its livelihood is its great market square, which attracts a number of travelling merchants who pass through.

It features a diverse population with humans making up the most common race, followed by elves and dwarves.
The governor and lord are both human.
The demeanour of the people is open and welcoming to the untrained eye, but none of the residents are suckers for a deal.

The town is also home to an output for the Ordo Magicae, largely due to the number of merchants that pass through and the scarcity of magical goods.
It also maintains a reasonably large standing garrison and is governed by a magistrate in service to the local lord.
The town is walled on both sides of the river, but the docks do not have any lock-gates.
The surrounding countryside is used for farming and a number of smaller hamlets or farmsteads dot the immediate landscape.

### The Docks

Situated on the east bank of the river are the docks.
They are lively and always busy, mooring space for trade vessels is at a premium.
Large warehouses line the streets nearby, as do a number of boarding houses and taverns.
The docks are generally safe all times of the day, with permanent city watch members patrolling at all times of day.

### The Market

On the west side of the river, visible from the docks, sits the great market.
It is open to the air, and centres on a statue of the town founder, that atop a large fountain.
The square itself is approximately the square-footage of 90HH.

The great market square has no permanent stands, and traders have to wheel their own carts or stalls in to sell their wares.
Permission to trade in the square is often acquired when first entering the town or by visiting the magistrates office.

### The Ordo Magicae Outpost

Halfyord is large enough to warrant a permanent outpost for the Ordo Magicae.
It is not as grand as a full guildhall, it essentially acts as an exclusive boarding lodge for members of the guild and a storeroom for moving and acquiring rare goods.
The permanent staff consist of a fully qualified mage who runs the outpost ("the ordinator") and their apprentice, along with some administrative staff and attendants.

During the day, the guildhall acts as both an emporium selling magical items, potions, and providing basic magical services like identification or warding.

The mages guild is located to the south of the great market.
It is a detached building, contrary to the rest of the street, and has 3 stories.
The top floors are lodgings for permanent staff, whilst the middle floor serves as the boarding house and kitchen for visitors, and houses the research lab.
The ground floor has a reception desk for enquires and the shop front.

### The Magistrates Office

The magistrates office is the public-facing courthouse, as well as the place of residence for the local governor.
It contains comfortable living quarters on the upper floors for the magistrate himself, and parliament-style chambers on the ground floor.
The building backs onto the guard barracks, which also contains the local jail.

Following the main street from the magistrates office will lead you directly to the great market.

### The Temple

Halfyord is home to an ecumenical temple to no particular deity, which is open to public worship and holds sermons on weekends.
It can be found on the eastern bank of the Hal, south of the docks and on the edge of the residential suburbs.
The temple grounds themselves are little more than a church with a large courtyard at the front.
Beyond the chapel itself are some small buildings that function as a vicarage - the clergy lives there, and they can provide cramped if functional lodgings for pilgrims and visiting priests, paladins, and the like.
It is also the de-facto hospital for the town, and gets most of its herbal supplies from the herbalist store on the other side of the river.

The temple is funded mostly by donations from pilgrims on their way to holy sites of greater import, and the healing services it provides.

### The Day's Rest Tavern

The Day's Rest is one of several taverns that can be found on the east side of Halfyord.
It's residents are typically locals from the surrounding suburbs, and it typically does not see much of the merchant traffic who typically stay either closer to the docks or on the west bank.

The building has guest lodgings on the first floor and a large meeting hall on the ground.
The meeting hall contains a hearth and the bar, which backs onto the kitchen.
There is a mezzanine level above the hearth for patrons, which leads to the guest rooms, and a private staircase behind the bar that leads to the owner's lodgings.
A trapdoor behind the bar leads down to the cellar and, unbeknownst to the public, leads to a secret storeroom which is the base of the Piranhas gang.
This section of the basement is also accessible from a sewer grate outside the rear of the building.

### Other Locations of Import

Off in the side streets that lead away from the market, on the west side of the Hal, a number of permanent shops can be found.
These include all the usual amenities like a:

- Blacksmith,
- Stables,
- Carpenter,
- General goods store,
- Pawnbroker,
- Jewellers,
- Herbalist,

etc.
The Ordo Magicae output serves as the emporium for magical goods and services, whilst the temple is the de-facto hospital that gets most of its supplies from the herbalist.
