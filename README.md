# The Piranhas of Halfyord

The prosperous merchant town of Halfyord has recently fallen on hard times.
The Piranhas - a criminal gang that was previously thought destroyed - has become resurgent and is launching devastatingly effective attacks on shipping and businesses within the town.
Rather worryingly, these heists have been magical in nature, and have coincided with the disappearance of a high-ranking wizard who resides in the town.
When a group of adventurers by chance finds themselves caught in the thick ofHalfyord's troubles, the town enlists their help in destroying the Piranhas once and for all.

## Logistical Info

The adventure assumes a party of 4 level 3 characters: this gives XP thresholds of the following:

- Easy: 75 * 4 = 300
- Medium: 150 * 4 = 600
- Hard: 225 * 4 = 900
- Deadly: 400 * 4 = 1600

However combats also provide details on how they can be scaled to accommodate a different number of player characters.

None of the combats in the adventure - save for the final confrontation if the party acts particularly brazenly - should ever be deadly.
There is potential for between 3 and 5 combat encounters over the course of the adventure; with a large aspect of social interaction, possible infiltration, and scouting elements being mixed in between.
Players should not have to take notes, but do remind them about the characters they've met if the adventure spans multiple sessions.

The rewards the party receives are intended to setup a "Western Marches" campaign style: the party will receive ownership of a tavern to use as a base, and a character from the adventure (Hope) is designed to serve as the caretaker for the building whilst the party is away.
