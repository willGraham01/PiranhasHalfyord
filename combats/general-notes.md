# General Notes about Combats

The size of the adventuring party will require the combat encounters to be scaled so they retain balance.
Ideas on how to do this are provided in the various files, where applicable.

It is also important to note that in a number of encounters - notably the opening scene in the market and the cargo heist at the docks - not all the hostile combatants have the intention of mortally wounding the party or fighting to the death.
This has been factored into the encounter balances.

The encounters in the hideout may get amalgamated into one, depending on the party's actions.
Conversely, the party might also manage to enter the hideout via the vault, which will potentially bypass the gang members in the first room.
