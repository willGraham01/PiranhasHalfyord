# Boss Combat

This combat takes place in the Piranhas's HQ room, with the party facing Carlton and Fordem (and an animated bear skin).

## Initial locations

Carlton will be sat at his desk directly opposite the doorway.
Fordem will be stood near the door to Carlton's private room, intending to use it as cover if a fight breaks out.
A bearskin rug is on the floor to the left of the doorway, as the party enters the room - it animates into a Brown Bear.

Intended encounter difficulty:  Hard

Carlton: 450 XP
Fordem: 25 XP
Bear: 200 XP

Multiplier (3 combatants): 2

Total XP: 675 x 2 = 1350 XP

A level 3 character's XP thresholds are 75 / 150 / 225 / 400.
So a party of 4 characters should make this a HARD encounter (225 x 4 = 900, 400 x 4 = 1600).
The more party members there are, the easier the combat should become.
Crucially, it should never become DEADLY!

NOTES:

- This is a fight to the death, surrender is beyond Carlton and Fordem at this point.
- Carlton and Fordem can be knocked unconscious, if the party wishes to take them alive. They will obviously attempt to escape if they are not bound and restrained when they come to conciousness.

Loot:

- Carlton has his two scimitars, and his golden tooth necklace. The blink ring and pistols can also be looted but will need repair before they are in a usable state.
- Fordem has his weapons and gold tooth necklace.
- The party is then free to loot the room(s).

Other encounter effects:

- Carlton will activate his blink ring on turn 1, and throw the potion on his desk to animate the bear before disappearing (his first blink is guaranteed).
- The bear takes a turn to animate (it joins the initiative order on round 2) and can take damage whilst is it being animated.
