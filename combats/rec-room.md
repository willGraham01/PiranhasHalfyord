# Combat in the Hideout Rec Room

This combat assumes the group entered the hideout in a non-LOUD fashion.
If they did not, the combatants from this encounter should be combined with those from the Carlton encounter, and they will all be present and alert when the party enters the recreation room in the hideout.

## Initial Locations

The number of gang members present is equal to the number of gang members who successfully escaped from the docks heist.
If none escaped the docks, have  2 gang members present at the games table, in conversation about how they think the heist is going and why it's taking everyone so long.

Otherwise, the gang members should be distributed around the recreation room.
Try to have at least two at the games table, and one in the bedroom asleep.
Gang members who escaped retain their HP and expended resources, if any were used.

Intended encounter difficulty: Easy / Medium

Enemies: equal to the number of gang members who escaped from the docks combat (min 2). There are no other combatants in this encounter.

NOTES:

- Gang members are cornered in their hideout.
- Gang members may attempt to flee to Carlton's room if the fight starts going poorly.

Loot:

- Shattered Teeth necklace off any killed or captured gang members.
- The party is then free to investigate the recreation room.

Other encounter effects:

- Entering combat will alert Fordem and Carlton in the HQ. When the party enters the corridor to the vault / HQ, they will see Fordem locking the vault and ducking into the HQ room.
