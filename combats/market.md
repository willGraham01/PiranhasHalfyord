# Combat in the Market

## Initial locations

Gang members should be near merchant stools and/or posted guards.
Loot wolves will also spawn near merchant goods.
These should be spread out across the market square, but each player should have one or two within reach of the first round of combat.

Intended encounter difficulty: Medium

| Party size | Gang members | Loot wolves | Other adjustments |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|-|
| 3- | = number of players | = number of players | |
| 4 | 3 | 5 | |
| 5 | 4 | 6 | |
| 6+ | 5 | = number of players | |

NOTES:

- Gang members will be attempting to flee rather than fight. They have invisibility potions to aid their escape, and do not want to start a killing.
- Loot wolves will flee unless provoked by the players. Loot wolves animated from non valuable goods will attempt delaying actions.

Loot:

- Piranhas necklace off any killed or captured gang members
- A ring or trinket from one of the merchant victims (if all the goods were saved by killing the loot wolves)

Other encounter effects:

- The market crowd will scatter when the animated wolves appear. Assume that the crowd acts first in combat and uses their action to move away from the scene, allowing freedom of movement. The merchant victims and their hirelings will also attempt to move to minimum safe distance.
- After a couple of PCs have gone in combat, the alarm bell will be raised by one of the on-duty guards. Mention that it starts to toll.
- After one round of combat, Shufharz and a garrison of nearby troops will be seen rushing down the main street from the barracks. They will arrive the following round. The gang members and loot wolves will heavily shift focus to getting away when this happens.
