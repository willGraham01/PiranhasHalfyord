# Combat at the Docks

## Initial Locations

If the gang's setup has gone to plan, there should be

- A gang member by the docking crane
- A gang member by the loading station
- A group of gang members emerging from the underpass and heading towards the merchant cart. If they were discovered before the ship arrived, they'll be approaching from the road.

Additionally, there will be a group of gang members on the bridge providing support, if Groubun was alerted the night before (the increased number of gang members is given in brackets).
As with the market, animated barrels and loot wolves will be spawned by the gang in the opening round of combat.
The loot wolves will spawn near the loading bay and merchant's cart - the barrels will spawn beside the crane.

Intended encounter difficulty: Medium / Hard (if Groubun alerted)

| Party size | Gang members | Loot wolves | Barrels | Other adjustments |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|-|
| 3- | 3 (4) | 2 | 2 | The underpass group consists of 1 gang member. |
| 4 | 4 (6) | 3 | 3 | The underpass group consists of 2 gang members. |
| 5 | 5 (7) | 3 | 4 | The underpass group consists of 2 gang members. |
| 6+ | 6 (+ number of players - 6) | 3 | = number of players - 1 | The underpass group consists of all but 4 of the standard number of gang members. |

NOTES:

- Gang members will be attempting to flee rather than fight. They have invisibility potions to aid their escape.
- Loot wolves will flee unless provoked by the players.
- Animated barrels will fight to the death, but should focus more on knocking characters prone or into the water.

Loot:

- Piranhas necklace off any killed or captured gang members.

Other encounter effects:

- The docks will be thrown into chaos when the fight starts. Civilians will attempt to flee the area.
- Shufharz and a guard retinue will have stationed themselves in the market and can be used as a Deux Ex Machina if needed to intercept fleeing enemies, etc.
