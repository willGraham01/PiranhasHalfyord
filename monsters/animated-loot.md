**Appearance**: Animated loot takes a canine form, having four legs and a body that is formed from the items affected by the [potion of animating](FIXME) that created it.
The colour, shape, texture, and smell of the creature is determined by the items that were animated to form it.

**Damage Vulnerabilities**: Depending on the items that were animated to create the animated loot, the DM may bestow additional resistances or vulnerabilities upon individual instances of this monster.

**Default Behaviour**: The animated loot follows the verbal or telepathic instructions of those who animated it, or their allies in the event of their death.
By default, animated loot will run to the designated rendezvous point (typically a vault or a safehouse) where it will remain until it de-animates and breaks down into its constituent parts.

**Magically Sustained**: After being animated for 1 hour, dropping to 0 hit points, or being the target of a successful magical dispelling affect, the magic sustaining the animated loot dissipates and it breaks down into the constituent parts that formed it.
These parts morph back into their original forms during this process, if originally deformed to form part of the animated loot's body.

## Actions
