**Impact**: Any creature hit by the animated barrel's *collision* attack is automatically pushed 5 ft. away from the barrel, in the direction of the barrel's travel.

**Lumbering**: The animated barrel cannot make opportunity attacks against creatures that leave it's melee range.
The animated barrel must move at least 5 ft. on its turn to use its *collision* attack, and can only attack a creature in this way if the creature is in the direction of its travel.

**Turning Circle**: It costs the animated barrel 5ft. of movement to change directions when it moves on its turn.

## Actions

**Collision**: *Melee weapon attack*, +5 to hit, reach 5ft., 1 target. Hit; 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Bonus Actions

**Drop and Roll**: The barrel can take the dash action as a bonus action on its turn. If it does so, it cannot change travel direction for the remainder of its turn.
