# Plot Premise

The party finds themselves (individually or already as an established group) in Halfyord for their various reasons.
Visiting the market square around late-lunch / early-afternoon, the group will be caught up in the latest heist action courtesy of the Shattered Teeth.

## The Market Attack

The Shattered Teeth know that, after their slightly botched attempt on the town treasury last week, that Shufharz and Kamonas know it is them behind the recent resurgence in criminal activity.
However, they also sense the pressure the town leadership is under to produce results, and so decide to make a show of force - and where better than the market square at the height of a working day to have the biggest impact?
As such, they have dispatched a team, equipped with the usual animate objects and invisibility potions to take what they can from the traders that might be passing through.

The party finds themselves in the market when this attack takes place.
They will have opportunities to become aware something is amiss beforehand, but combat is by-and-large assured.
During the chaos, the gang will try to escape with what they can carry.
The garrison is only up the road at the magistrates office, so after a short while Shufharz will arrive with an escort to help the party in the combat if it is going poorly.
Otherwise, they will arrive just as the action is settling down.

After handling the fallout of the market attack, Shufharz will insist that they come with her to the magistrates office, and leave a squad in the market to restore order and take stock of what was lost.
There will be time for the party to look around, investigate the area, etc before heading across.
The longer they linger, the more Shufharz will start to be heckled by the local merchants which will motivate her to move things along.

## Hired Help

Shufharz will take the party directly to Kamonas' office - depending on the way the market played out Kamonas will be somewhere between strained but welcoming for the help, or sceptical of what aid the party can give.
Shufharz will insist that the party help them if they share, or she learns through interrogation on the way to the magistrates, they are from out-of-town.
Shufharz suspects that there is an inside agent or fairly powerful individual who is able to keep tabs on herself, Kamonas, and the garrison and this information is being fed to the gang.
Her and Kamonas will also share their belief that the gang's use of potions and magic is not unrelated to the disappearance of Ordinator (Faire) Ron-Ron - the timing is too convenient.
They will also provide a recollection of the events detailed in the story background, and the situation the town now finds itself in.

The party will be given several avenues to pursue, which can in theory be in any order but Shufharz will suggest they follow up with the Ordo Magicae outpost for the rest of the day, then come back after a rest for the docks mission.

- The Ordo Magicae is missing it's ordinator but is assisting with investigations for obvious reasons. Groubun is under a lot of pressure as the acting head but has tried to be helpful (or keep up this appearance). Shufharz will recommend they talk to Jenessa, since she mentioned that she might be able to cobble together something that will help combat the gang's newfound magical powers. She'll also recommend they introduce themselves to Groubun, though this is optional but may give more clues.
- Shufharz, Jenessa, Kamonas and trusted members of the city guard are staging a false-flag delivery to the docks tomorrow morning. Information has been leaked that a number of alchemical ingredients are aboard, as well as valuable gems for spell components. Groubun is not in on this plan due to his business as acting Ordinator, though Jenessa was not forbidden from withholding the plan from him if he asked about it. The group is hoping to expose the gang and trace them back to their hideout.

By the time the conversation finishes, it will be late afternoon / early evening.
There will be time to head to the Ordo outpost before it closes, or the group may decide to scout out the docks first to do some preparations.
They may try to squeeze in both (though there is the chance this will tip Groubun off if he catches wind of the plan in their visit).
Shufharz will provide the group with access to the case files (IE if they need a recap of the info, they can find it) and will offer a few garrison beds that her injured soldiers staying at the temple have vacated.

## Ordo Magicae (in the evening)

If the party chooses to head to the Ordo Magicae in the evening, they will find the entrance desk unattended.
Jenessa will be closing up the store front, but will respond if the party rings the front bell or walks into the store of their own accord.

There are several things the party can learn and do at the Ordo:

- They can introduce themselves to Jenessa. She can answer some of their questions, and can provide the assistance Shufharz promised in the form of a magic ring. The ring is in the Ordo's lab, which will give them a chance to run into Groubun.
- The store's supplies look pretty barren, but if the party asks Jenessa will part with a healing potion or two.
- The lab is where Faire, Groubun, and occasionally Jenessa do their research. Groubun might be in here when the party arrives, or he might be in his chambers and come down before heading out. In the lab the gang may notice some oddities; most reagents and shelves are empty save for ingredients associated with polymorph & invisibility effects, Groubun's desk will have notes on a collar of antimagic (that cat-Faire is wearing).
- Some members of the group may choose to sneak away and explore the upper floors of the Ordo. They run the risk of encountering Groubun, or some of the other staff members who will reprimand their inquisition. The common area will have notices up from the Ordo HQ about the process of selecting a replacement Ordinator, Jenessa can also provide this information if asked.
- Groubun's room has a locked desk. Inside are blueprints for the potions that the gang are using to animate the treasure, alongside an article that has bot his and Faire's names on.
- Groubun himself will be heading out to the Day's Rest soon. Jenessa knows he likes a drink, but doesn't know where he frequents. The party might encounter him if they spend too much time with Jenessa on the ground floor - he will insist they leave his lab to allow him to do some confidential research, but will be cordial about it for the facade of promotion.

By the end of their visit, the party will hopefully have Jenessa's ring and have noticed some of the other clues in and around the Ordo.
They shouldn't be suspicious of anyone in particular, but they should hopefully notice some inconsistencies in the reports Jenessa is giving about the state of the Ordo, the available supplies, and any of the other contextual clues.

If the party heads to the Ordo after scoping out the docks, Groubun will be in the lab when they arrive.
He will leave partway through their conversation, making any infiltration of the upper floors slightly easier _and_ avoiding arousing his suspicion if he passes them at the docks.
But the party will loose the opportunity to tail him to the Day's Rest as they should only learn of any slight clues that he might be up to no good after he leaves.

## Docks (in the evening)

The party might choose to scope out the docks, and in particular the area that Shufharz or Jenessa points them to as the mooring site for the fabricated merchant ship.
There will be guards at the docks, depending on whether the group has visited the Ordo, word will have been passed to the guard on who they are.

This gives the players a chance to scope out the area and do some planning for the day itself.
Astute players will notice the sewage pipes that drain from the east bank into the river - these connect to the wider town sewage system and in particular to the Day's Rest.
The main pipe can be entered by a medium creature, but quickly becomes too narrow to make progress further in - but dog-sized creatures could probably squeeze through.

Groubun will pass through across one of the bridges visible from the docks during the party's visit if they went to the Ordo first.
If they stayed long enough to encounter him, he will take note of their presence here and at the Ordo speaking with Jenessa (even if they don't reveal to him they are helping Shufharz) - the resulting encounter during the day will feature more Shattered Teeth presence.

The party may choose to tail Groubun if they notice him pass by.
He will be heading to the Day's End to deliver the next round of potions to the gang's leaders.
The group will arrive to a busy tavern in the full swing of the evening.
Fordem will be at the bar and Hope will be serving, Faire the cat will be in the tavern too - Hope will mention the cat is a relatively new addition and "hasn't settled" yet.
Forden will protect Groubun and deny seeing him that evening (as will the bouncers, etc) because Groubun will be downstairs in the hideout handing off the potions (and maybe tipping Carlton off).
Hope however will mention that Groubun arrived and is a regular here, although notes that he does just seem to pop up in the tavern during the evening and she can never pin down where he's sitting.
She will also let slip that Fordem and Groubun are good friends, mechanically this should cast suspicion on Fordem.

The players may recognise the collar on Faire if they took note in the Ordo.
If they speak too openly, he might even try to get their attention... as might Fordem.

Theoretically, the party may discover the gang hideout if they show enough ingenuity and get lucky with dice rolls.
There is nothing stopping them from doing so - whether by forcing their way in or causing a ruckus and sneaking through instead.
If so, they will jump directly to "infiltrating the hideout" - however, Groubun will be present and will side with the gang if not swayed otherwise.

## Docks (the planted cargo)

After resting for the evening, the party will be woken up by Shafharz' aides in the morning to go through the plan for the fake shipment.
If the party has scouted out the area, Shufharz will have been told this by her guard and will ask if they have any further leads or if there is anything in the environment they want to take advantage of.
The party can also inform her of any insights that came from tracking Groubun.

The plan is to lure the gang out with this shipment, which in reality contains mundane kitchen items, building supplies, and the like.
Guard presence will be deliberately made to appear lighter than usual, many members of the guard will be plain clothed.

The Shattered Teeth will send a team to capture the shipment in their usual manner - potions to animate what they want to steal, invisibility for the members themselves.
Anything they animate will return to the hideout via the shortest possible route - normally this would be to use the sewer pipe, however if the goods are animated after being unloaded onto the west bank then anything animated will travel using the streets towards the Day's Rest (or leave a trail that can be followed with Jenessa's ring).
The gang members themselves will not lead the party back to the hideout directly - if they are tailed, they will try to make sure they've thrown off their pursuers before returning.
The gang members also do not want to die, or be captured - they will prefer to flee and leave the loot if they're at risk.

Conversely, the gang members must be made to believe that the cargo is valuable - if it is unloaded and they discover it is actually a plant, they will immediately flee the scene.
They can be prompted into acting impulsively by removing their invisibility as they approach the target (whilst it is being unloaded), a suitable "distraction" being held such as the players engaging the dock-master in conversion or pretending to be customs agents, or any other inventive ideas the party comes up with like a rival gang attempting a heist.
Shufharz will mention this caveat to the players in the initial briefing or the morning planning session otherwise.

## On the trial of the gang (the Day's Rest)

At this point, the party's investigation should lead them to conclude there is something amiss with the Day's Rest.
Once they arrive, there are multiple ways they might choose to proceed with their investigation.
If Faire recognises them from the previous night, he will attempt to assist in cat form.

If they followed the sewer trail from above ground, they can trace it back to the rear of the tavern.
The back alley will have a manhole cover which connects to the sewers directly below, and can be used to access the gang's vault via the "treasure route" that the animated goods take.
The manhole cover will not have any sentries, unless the gang members were actively pursued to the tavern itself.
If the gang slips into the vault from the inside, they might be able to catch Carlton unawares.

Alternatively, the gang can head inside the tavern to attempt to access the hideout from the trapdoor behind the bar.
This will likely lead to a fight with Fordem and whichever bouncers he has on hand - Hope will not help either side unless convinced beforehand that the gang is right under their nose.
Once the fight is resolved, Fordem can be looted for the cellar key.
Hope, if onside, can point out the cellar access to the party - failing this, Faire as a cat can attempt to draw attention to it.
Heading down into the cellar will give the party access to the hideout from the _intended_ entrance, which will loose them the element of surprise.

## Infiltrating the Hideout

The hideout is essentially the gang's safehouse and headquarters, but it is not a permanent residence for all the members.
Only Carlton and Fordem have permanent lodgings, and Fordem has to bunk with the rest of the gang members that cycle through the hideout.

Entering through the cellar, the party will face several challenges they'll need to overcome:

- They need to find the entrance to the hideout, via a hidden wall switch.
- The gathering hall will have gang members present, and they will notice the wall opening from the cellar.
- Making too much noise might attract Carlton from his planning room.
- Carlton himself will be present in the hideout, if undisturbed he will be in his drawing room.

The gathering hall will have evidence that can incriminate Groubun, with the notice board even giving the location for the next supply exchange.
The makeshift supply area in the gathering hall also contains a detailed log of the supplies the gang has available.

The lodgings contain some more of the necklaces that the gang members wear, some spare sets of plain clothes, and a few weapon racks.
The party might get a slight weapon upgrade from looting them.

The vault contains most of the stolen goods of the past few weeks and months, and is sealed behind a heavy door.
If entering from the sewers, the party will find themselves inside the vault and looking for a way out.
Carlton has a key to the vault on him at all times.

Carlton's planning room contains a few items of interest:

- There is a runic key to unlock the collar that Faire is wearing, in Carlton's personal footlocker in his room.
- There are a few doses of "potions of dispelling", which Carlton has been told can reverse the animation of the treasure early if they need it. These can also be used to "revert" Faire.
- Carlton's desk contains a number of schematics and plans that it looks like the gang has had in storage for a while. It also contains correspondence (albeit cryptic) with Groubun.

Carlton himself has a golden tooth necklace unlike the silver ones the grunts of the gang carry.
The party can loot this as a trophy to prove to Shufharz that Carlton is present and/or dead.

<!-- Move this stuff to the relevant scene info!-->
Entering from the trapdoor behind the bar, the party will find themselves in the wine cellar.
They will have to infer that one set of barrels is lighter than the other, and there are scratch marks and broken wood chippings on the floor leading away from the lighter barrel stack.
Moving these barrels will reveal a wall with the gang's emblem on - pressing it will open the wall-door into the hideout.

Going through the wall will place the gang in the gathering hall that the gang has underground.
There are two further exits on either side of the far side of the room, both with closed doors.
Immediately in front of the wall-door is a desk and a makeshift supply dump that the gang has been using for their magical items and potions.
There is a logbook on the desk which details which materials are assigned to who for which heists or missions.
The centre of the room is taken up by a recreation area - there are rugs and cushions to form a seating area, and a table with cards and games left lying around.
There is a notice board on the wall just beside the "games" table which has gang announcements of sorts.
In particular, there will be a "next delivery exchange" note which may incriminate Groubun.
The far end of the room has a table that's used as an eatery, and an unkempt bookshelf.

Taking the door at the far end of the room on the same wall as that which leads to the cellar will take the party to the lodgings.
There are several beds in here, a few weapon racks with various items missing or mislaid, some spare plain clothes in wardrobes, and a number of silver-shark-tooth necklaces similar to those that the party might have recovered from gang members they've encountered before.

The door opposite to the lodgings is reinforced, and leads into a log corridor lit by scones.
At the end of the corridor there are two sets of doors facing each other.

The first has a heavy lock and iron bars across it - this is the gang's vault.
Inside is most of the valuables that the gang has managed to steal since Groubun begun assisting them.
If the party manages to infiltrate the sewers they will enter directly into the vault (from the "ceiling") behind the reinforced door and will have to figure out a way to get through it!

The other door is again reinforced but unlocked and leads to Carlton's planning room, and a door further in to his private room.
Carlton will be in here waiting for the party if they manage to sneak through undetected, otherwise he may be drawn out of his HQ by any scuffles that occur in the gathering hall.

## Confrontations

Whilst the gang is still getting back on its feet, Carlton is still ultimately looking to get out with as much as he can take.
His deal with Groubun is only for convenience, and given enough incentive (either by the party taking him by surprise, or the sudden raid on his hideout) he may be inclined to spill the beans on the whole plan in exchange for his getaway.

Otherwise, the party will have to fight him and his men.
Killing Carlton solves one of Shufharz' problems, and the gang can then learn the truth if they manage to piece together Faire's cat-form-problem.
If they cannot find Faire's whereabouts, they'll have to report back to Shufharz anyway.
If the discovered the documents detailing the next drop-off meeting, they can catch Groubun in the act and solve the mystery that way.

## Conclusions

With Carlton out of the picture, the gang's activities will grind to a halt and Shufharz' garrison can regain control of the town.
The wealth in the vault can be redistributed where possible too.

Groubun will be arrested if the plot against Faire is uncovered.
Faire will be restored to Ordinator if he is cured, otherwise Jenessa will become acting Ordinator if Faire is not discovered.

Kamonas will be delighted if the party produces results, but will stop short of offering a monetary reward due to the chaos that the redistribution of wealth is going to cause in the next few days.
Instead, she will extend the offer of a reward in the form of ownership of the Day's Rest now that it's true purpose is revealed.
Hope can be convinced to continue working there as caretaker / bartender if the party got her onside before the hideout raid (or she was otherwise unaware of it).
