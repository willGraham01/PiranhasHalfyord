# Plot Premise

The party finds themselves (individually or already as an established group) in Halfyord for their various reasons.
Visiting the market square around late-lunch / early-afternoon, the group will be caught up in the latest heist action courtesy of the Shattered Teeth.

## The Market Attack

The Shattered Teeth know that, after their slightly botched attempt on the town treasury last week, that Shufharz and Kamonas know it is them behind the recent resurgence in criminal activity.
However, they also sense the pressure the town leadership is under to produce results, and so decide to make a show of force - and where better than the market square at the height of a working day to have the biggest impact?
As such, they have dispatched a team, equipped with the usual animate objects and invisibility potions to take what they can from the traders that might be passing through.

The party finds themselves in the market when this attack takes place.
They will have opportunities to become aware something is amiss beforehand, but combat is by-and-large assured.
During the chaos, the gang will try to escape with what they can carry.
The garrison is only up the road at the magistrates office, so after a short while Shufharz will arrive with an escort to help the party in the combat if it is going poorly.
Otherwise, they will arrive just as the action is settling down.

After handling the fallout of the market attack, Shufharz will insist that they come with her to the magistrates office, and leave a squad in the market to restore order and take stock of what was lost.
There will be time for the party to look around, investigate the area, etc before heading across.
The longer they linger, the more Shufharz will start to be heckled by the local merchants which will motivate her to move things along.

## Hired Help

Shufharz will take the party directly to Kamonas' office - depending on the way the market played out Kamonas will be somewhere between strained but welcoming for the help, or sceptical of what aid the party can give.
Shufharz will insist that the party help them if they share, or she learns through interrogation on the way to the magistrates, they are from out-of-town.
Shufharz suspects that there is an inside agent or fairly powerful individual who is able to keep tabs on herself, Kamonas, and the garrison and this information is being fed to the gang.
Her and Kamonas will also share their belief that the gang's use of potions and magic is not unrelated to the disappearance of Ordinator (Faire) Ron-Ron - the timing is too convenient.
They will also provide a recollection of the events detailed in the story background, and the situation the town now finds itself in.

The party will be given several avenues to pursue, which can in theory be in any order but Shufharz will suggest they follow up with the Ordo Magicae outpost for the rest of the day, then come back after a rest for the docks mission.

- The Ordo Magicae is missing it's ordinator but is assisting with investigations for obvious reasons. Groubun is under a lot of pressure as the acting head but has tried to be helpful (or keep up this appearance). Shufharz will recommend they talk to Jenessa, since she mentioned that she might be able to cobble together something that will help combat the gang's newfound magical powers. She'll also recommend they introduce themselves to Groubun, though this is optional but may give more clues.
- Shufharz, Jenessa, Kamonas and trusted members of the city guard are staging a false-flag delivery to the docks tomorrow morning. Information has been leaked that a number of alchemical ingredients are aboard, as well as valuable gems for spell components. Groubun is not in on this plan due to his business as acting Ordinator, though Jenessa was not forbidden from withholding the plan from him if he asked about it. The group is hoping to expose the gang and trace them back to their hideout.

By the time the conversation finishes, it will be late afternoon / early evening.
There will be time to head to the Ordo outpost before it closes, or the group may decide to scout out the docks first to do some preparations.
They may try to squeeze in both (though there is the chance this will tip Groubun off if he catches wind of the plan in their visit).
Shufharz will provide the group with access to the case files (IE if they need a recap of the info, they can find it) and will offer a few garrison beds that her injured soldiers staying at the temple have vacated.
