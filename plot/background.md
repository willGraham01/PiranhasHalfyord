## Background

### A New Ordinator

Faire Ron-Ron's research into magical items, effects, and spells has ground almost to a standstill in terms of innovation - however this goes largely unbeknownst to him.
As such, about 2 years ago he was politically assigned the post of Ordinator at the Ordo Magicae outpost in Halfyord.
This was presented to Faire as a promotion - he would be in charge of the outpost in its entirely and be given the right to take on an apprentice.
The outpost itself is an important part of the wider order as it serves as their primary supply hub, and allows them to get the drop on things when magical items or substances happen to pass through.
However, the higher-ups in the Ordo who gave Faire knew that these supply procurement and advisory roles to the city magistrate would mean that Faire would have little to no time for his "research".

Since his appointment and subsequent move to Halfyord, Faire has taken on a modest staff at the outpost - totalling around 6 or so members of the order.
Staff members of import are:

- Acolyte Jenessa, who has been at her current role in the outpost for nearly 100 years as the face of the Ordo - manning the front desk, directing visitors to the relevant parts of the attached emporium, and managing appointments for the Ordinator.
- Groubun Stoneclimber, the selected apprentice of Faire who moved with him to Halfyord when the "promotion" was secured.

The other staff members handle busywork jobs around the town, manual labour, lab and dorm cleaning, etc and are not Ordo members.

### Broken Jaws

The Shattered Teeth are a criminal gang whose influence in Halfyord has taken a hit in the past year.
Thanks largely to the coordinated efforts of Captain Shufharz and her garrison, many members have been arrested or forced into hiding.
Their smuggling and bribery operations around the docks have essentially been stamped out, with the gang only able to perform to a fraction of their former capacity due to the loss of the corrupt officials shielding them and the presence of the garrison on the docks.
Most of the population of Halfyord see the gang as a leech on society, and the captain's campaign against them has widespread support of the local populace.
This has also spilled over into Governor Kamonas' popularity due to her role in appointing Shufharz in the first place.

The gang have managed to preserve the secrecy of their hideout's location, below the Day's Rest tavern, from the captain's knowledge and have "amped up" the facade of the tavern front - hiring new staff (Hope) but also ensuring that the Fordem runs the bar and the bouncer-security are all gang members.
The leader, Shark Carlton, is essentially under de-facto house arrest in the hideout due to his infamy in the town.
He is also in a tight spot - he needs to find a way to either get the gang back on it's feet and in the money again, otherwise he'll face a mutiny.
But he also can't risk leaving the hideout and getting caught above ground.

### A Bitter Apprentice

However, Faire still believes himself to be pushing the boundaries of magical research - and whilst his existing knowledge is extensive, he is wrong in this regard.
His obliviousness to this fact has resulted in him largely neglecting his wider duties as Ordinator, the responsibility of which has fallen onto Jenessa.
It has also caused Groubun to become bitter towards his supervisor - many of Groubun's achievements are forced to carry Faire's by association, and Faire is often assumed to be the one who should be given the bulk of the credit.
Groubun also had ambitions to move up in the Ordo, which he know realises have been halted given his supervisor's current position.
He also realises the divergence in his and his supervisor's interest; Groubun has always been more of an alchemist and artificer, whilst Faire is more focused on direct manipulation of the weave of magic.

Groubun is a regular at the Day's Rest Tavern, and in the past few months has frequented the tavern and often run his mouth about his situation at the Ordo.
Upon hearing a few variations of his rant, Fordem gradually gained the trust of the apprentice over the span of a month of visits - playing on sympathy to earn Groubun's trust and learn about his role and skills in the Ordo.
Fordem relayed this information to Carlton who sensed an opportunity to strike an arrangement with the apprentice; the Shattered Teeth could benefit from some magical assistance to start up the stream of funds heading into the gang's coffers, and conversely might be able to speed up Groubun's career progression.

### The Deal

The next evening Groubun was in the tavern, he was lead into a meeting room with Carlton and several other gang members, and the olive branch was extended.
Groubun was initially hesitant, knowing Carlton by reputation but being enticed by his "friendship" with Fordem and the opportunity to get his career back on track.

Groubun needed Faire to disappear, but it was not as simple as disappearing permanently - if Faire turned up dead, there would surely be a wider investigation from the Ordo and local authorities.
Conversely, Faire had to be missing for long enough that Groubun could display his aptitude for Faire's role - which would fall to him in an acting capacity until Faire resurfaced.

The Teeth's needs were more direct - they needed a source of income, and they needed it fast.
Fortunately, Groubun was in a position to provide them with the equipment and potions they might need to do just that - provided they could provide the raw materials.
Conversely, and materials the gang could provide would be "off the books" - if Groubun stole from the Ordo's supplies then that would again draw the scrutiny of the higher ups in the order.

Eventually a plan was conceived:

- Groubun would use some alchemical components provided by the gang to create a potion of true polymorph, and administer it to Faire.
- The animal Faire would then be delivered to the Day's Rest to live out the next 3 months as the tavern pet or gang captive.
- During these 3 months, Groubun would then provide the means to aid the Shattered Teeth gang based on the components they could gather.
- After 3 months, the gang would move the loot they had garnered out of the hideout, and escape out of town to move onto greener pastures. Faire would be planted in the gang's old hideout, and the guards tipped off. Faire would likely spin a story about the true events and it being a plant, but with suitable evidence planted, circumstance, and Groubun's "helpfulness" with the guard's investigation, Faire would be out of the picture permanently.

Groubun's aid to the gang mostly came in the form of potions and low-level magic items, since these do not depend on the user's magical prowess.
Invisibility potions and potions of animate objects proved to be particularly useful for gang heists: an invisible thief had a much easier time breaking and entering, and animate objects could be used to make small but expensive items like coins, jewellery, and gems smuggle themselves!
With the gang being able to revitalise its smuggling operations, the variety of "off the books" resources that Groubun had available to him meant he was able to provide other things to ensure the plan went off smoothly - fashioning an antimagic collar for Faire (now the unwilling tavern cat) and more powerful elixirs and potions for the gang to use.
The gang too grew in boldness; small-scale home thefts became more successful and frequent thanks to their helper from the Ordo.
Over the past month, these small-scale home thefts have given way to more ambitious heists - shops were robbed during the night seemingly without any signs of break _ins_, only break _outs_.

A week before the adventure takes place, an attempt was made on the town treasury in the magistrate's office.
This heist was partially successful; guards managed to arrive on the scene after being alerted by the silent alarm (spells) that protected the vault.
Those guards that arrived reported having to fend off animated beasts seemingly made of silver, jade, and other expensive materials that when struck seemed to break down into coins, gems, and other components that made up part of the treasury.
Whilst the theft was interrupted, no gang members were arrested and part of the treasury was lost - a careless gang member did drop a silver tooth trinket in the escape though.
Combined with the rejuvenated activity of the Shattered Teeth, this was enough to implicate the gang, but fresh leads were nonexistant.

## The Present Day

Halfyord is in a state of unrest and at risk of jeopardising the trade that has allowed it to become so prosperous.
Captain Shufharz and Kamonas are under pressure to produce results from both the public, merchants, and the lord of the land.
There is a missing Ordinator, and magic-assisted heists taking place (although the latter detail is not known to the public yet) - the Captain and Governor are not niave enough to believe the two are unrelated.

The Ordo is being called on to help with the investigation, however Groubun has done a good job of feigning ignorance through adjusting to his "enforced" new role.
He has been helpful in suggesting which magical effects the town guard might be facing, but claims that unless the Ordo can be supplied, he cannot produce anything to help the garrison combat the gang.
Of course, Groubun knows that the reason no-one can get their hands on the relevant supplies is because the Shattered Teeth are prioritising their procurement, to then supply him "off the books" and ensure the cycle continues.

Jenessa is mostly relieved that the acting Ordinator seems to be taking on the responsibilities his predecessor did not, and has high expectations for Groubun in his new role.
She is not an expert on the effects that the Captain is reporting, but has pledged to dig up any artefacts in storage that the Ordo might be able to provide to help.
Groubun has discouraged this - under the guise that these artefacts cannot be "risked" - and done his best to delay this help whilst also appearing to be in support of the investigation.

The Day's Rest tavern has seen an uptake in business as residents are more inclined to spend their day's wages rather than risk it being stolen in the night.
Fordem and the other gang members still manage the front and keep an eye out for intruders, and Hope works there most nights but is ignorant of the tavern's real owners.
A sewer grate out the back of the tavern has been redirected into the basement, to allow any animated treasure to transfer itself into the gang's vault un-noticed.
Gold, gems, and other valuables moving through a grate and landing in a pile doesn't come without some noise to the kitchen staff - Hope puts it down to vermin living in the cellar that Fordem never cleans out.
Shark Carlton's position is much more secure, and the gang is once again on the up.
If Shufharz or Kamonas are removed from office, it's likely that he'll once again be able to escape his de-facto house arrest.
