# The Docks at Night

The party will arrive here either with Shufharz, coming directly from the magistrate's office, or having gone via the Ordo Magicae first to pickup items from Jenessa.
The scene plays out normally when the party first goes via the Ordo outposts, differences are listed at the end if they chose to visit the locations in the opposite direction.

It is around 7/8pm in the evening by this point, depending on the order of the day's events.
It is dark but the streets are lit well enough to not impede investigation, and Shufharz' soldiers carry torches.

## The Dockyard

Shufharz has selected a particular docking station, near the bridge over town, as the location for the plant.
Shufharz will provide the party with a briefing about the arranged events and important locations at the docks:

- The boat will moor at this docking station, and the cargo will be unloaded whilst the ship's captain talks to the harbourmaster.
- The cargo has been listed as a collection of precious gems and alchemical ingredients that is en route to the Ordo, but in reality contains mundane items like furniture, vegetables, and salted meats.
- Shufharz herself will be patrolling at the far end of the docking station. (In reality, this ensures that she will be too far away from the action to help during the day so the players have more agency).
- Notable lookout points include the bridge itself, the docking crane, and near the mooring station.
- Notable places where there is a lack of vision include underneath the bridge (where the docking platform extends under the arch of the bridge), as well as the bridge itself.

Shufharz will ask the party to decide on the roles they want to perform during the day.
If a character wants to be on the ship itself, this can be arranged provided they wake up earlier than the rest of the group and ride downriver for 2 hours to get on the boat before it arrives.
Shufharz will also remind them of the insignia of the Piranhas, and the usual docking procedures.
She'll also reiterate that the gang needs to be lead to believe the contents really are valuable before they'll attempt to strike.
The objective is to follow the gang back to either their hideout or the location that they are "sending" the loot.

Shufharz will also give the party each a one earring in a set of networked earrings of message; this allows the party members to cast message to each other (and anyone else on the earring network, which includes Shufharz).
This will allow the party to communicate should they decide to split up now, later in the evening, or for tomorrow.
Shufharz will request these back from the party once the adventure is complete.

## Investigating the Area

With the dockyard map up, the party can scope out the area for clues, traps, and other things.
Reward ingenuity with appropriate checks, and likewise allow the party characters to take on any roles that they might want during the heist (such as posing as the harbourmaster or ship captain, etc).
The notable locations of interest are listed below, along with anything that can be found there.

### The Mooring Station

The mooring station consists of a straight platform like one might see on a canal, with hitching posts that boats can attach to.
Wooden pallets can then be used to bridge a walkway between the moored ship and the dockyard itself.
The mooring station has an unloading area where the cargo is normally moved to, on a level slightly above the mooring station itself.
The station is a good 50 feet or so from the crane and the bridge.
Shufharz will brief the players at this location so can provide any ideas based on the player's investigations.

- Dockworkers ferry the cargo on and off the ship as they arrive, so a character could pose as one of these un-loaders. Players can use this to "pretend" the cargo is something that it isn't; EG by deliberately making out that what they're carrying is heavy, or glowing, or has a particular smell, etc.
- The harbourmaster usually discusses the logistics of the unloading with the ship's captain on the raised level above the loading area.
- (Investigation / Insight / Perception DC 10) This area is open to the public, so the party might conclude this is a location from which the gang might attempt to throw their potions. Party members could also pose as members of the public here.
- (Investigation / Perception DC 15, ADV: Thieves' Cant or criminal background, ADV: The party has previously found one of the gang's marks) The character notices markings etched into the low wall on the upper level near where the cargo is unloaded. It has the same mark as the gang's necklace design that the party has encountered, along with some other arrows sketched around it.
- (History DC 15, AUTO: Thieves' Cant) The mark can be deciphered as indicating a meeting spot or staging post.

### The Docking Crane

The docking crane is adjacent to the bridge, but on a much lower level.
It sits above the cargo loading level, and is winch operated with two cranks.

- (AUTO) A quick inspection of how the crane operates will give a character the idea that they can feign the weight of unloaded goods by deliberately operating the crane slowly.
- (Perception DC 10) The crane can be operated in such a way that the cargo can be lifted from the loading area over the river, rather than onto the main road where a cart would presumably be waiting. The party can use this to ensure they know where the gang members will be aiming to use their magic, and present an "easy" target.
- (Investigation DC 10) A manifest and loading order is present beside the crane, on a large billboard. It details the unloading schedule for tomorrow and the goods to be unloaded. The party can add their delivery to this manifest to telegraph to the gang members that this mooring station is where the "valuables" will be arriving.
- (Survival / Suitable toolset DC 10) The crane looks like it can be rapidly swung in a large (30ft) arc along any level of loading area. This would undoubtedly force anything _in_ those regions to rapidly vacate the area of suffer some painful consequences.
- (Investigation / Perception DC 15, ADV: Thieves' Cant or criminal background, ADV: The party has previously found one of the gang's marks) There is a gang mark next the billboard.
- (History DC 15, AUTO: Thieves' Cant) The mark can be deciphered as indicating that information or recon can be gathered from this location.

### The Bridge Underpass

The bridge underpass is dark and narrow. The arch of the bridge reduces the width of the walkway by about half, though there is a banister on the river facing side.
Only a single torch sconce is present in the walkway, and it is not lit.
It is also placed fairly high up the arch, out of reach from the walkway.
Looking through the underpass, a character can see that the docks continue on the other side with a few more mooring stations, though the loading / unloading infrastructure is not present.
This part of the docks is for transport ships and private ventures.

It is dark under the bridge - without a light source or darkvision, checks to investigate the area are at disadvantage.

- (History / Investigation / Perception DC 15) The arch of the bridge is well-kept and crafted from stone. Most of the mossy plant life that you would expect to see has been cleaned off - likely to keep up appearances for the town.
- (Survival / Nature DC 15, ADV: The absence of mossy plant life has been noted) The moss that remains is not typically found near canals or rivers - it looks like a garden climber plant that one might see decorating a house or mansion.
- (Investigation / Perception DC 20, ADV: Thieves' Cant or criminal background, ADV: The party has previously found one of the gang's marks) The plant life conceals a gang mark.
- (History DC 15, AUTO: Thieves' Cant) The mark can be deciphered as indicating that a cache is located nearby. This mark simply translates to a phrase: light the way.

If the party lights the single unlit torch, they will find that it does not catch with non-magical means.
In fact, it does not seem to even be material - it is in fact an illusion.
Any magical effect that can either create a light to place over the illusion, modify the illusion itself so the torch appears lit, or simply dispel the illusion, will trigger the secret cache to open.
When it does, a small hole in the brickwork behind the vines will fade away, revealing an approx 10-by-10-by-10ft alcove containing the following supplies, intended for the gang members tomorrow:

- Potions of invisibility (20 minutes, one for every 2 gang members that will be present).
- Sets of plain clothes, similar to what travellers might wear.
- Sets of dockworkers clothes.

The party should be able to infer that this means at least 5 gang members will be present tomorrow; one of which will be posing as a member of the public and another as a dock worker.
If the party wants, they can remove any items from the cache and the gang will not have them at their disposal tomorrow.

### The Bridge

Heading up a stone set of stairs will take a character from the dock level to the bridge, or alternatively the road can be followed past the loading crane in a gentle slope and in a U-turn to arrive back at the bridge without needing to use steps.
The bridge is well lit with gas-powered street lamps - from the bridge one can see along the entire length of the docks.
The bridge itself is approximately 5 stories (30ft) higher than the loading area, and has decorative bannisters and railings along its edges.
The main road across town runs through the middle, with a wide pavement for pedestrians either side.
A number of members of the public will be going about their business on the bridge if a member of the party heads up there.

- (Perception DC 15) From this vantage point, a character notices that there is a sewer grate with a missing cover on the same side of the docks as the mooring station. The grate empties out into the river, and there are several more along the docks at each mooring station that have a cover.
- There are no gang marks up here, searching for them invokes the same checks as before but always turns up nothing. However, a character might infer that this is a particularly good vantage point to watch the area from - though Jenessa's ring will be out of range.

### Groubun's Passby

If the party goes to the docks before the Ordo Magicae, skip this section.
The players will have a chance to tail Groubun when he leaves the Ordo in a rush, when they get there next.
Otherwise, once the party seems to have completed their investigations, have this event trigger.

If any characters go up to the bridge to inspect it, resolve that area last.
After their initial investigations, the party members up on the bridge might notice the figure of Groubun going across the bridge.

- (Perception, DC 12 PASSIVE) The party notices Groubun crossing the bridge.
- (Stealth, DC 10) Any members on the bridge avoid drawing the attention of Groubun.
- (Insight, DC 12) Groubun is walking at a faster pace than most other members of the public. Still at walking speed, but there is a purpose to his step.

As Groubun walks across the bridge, someone will bump into him, causing a small clattering of bottles onto the pavement.

- (Perception, DC 10 PASSIVE) A character not on the bridge hears the clattering of bottles.
- (Perception, DC 12 PASSIVE) An apologetic exchange is heard between a member of the public and a voice that is recognised as Groubun's.

The party should hopefully recall that Groubun's reason for excusing himself was to do research in his study, and have their suspicions raised.
Doubly so by the fact that he is carrying bottles of something, and they have seen him brewing potions in the lab earlier.
The party may decide to follow Groubun, or if Shufharz heard the exchange and was informed about the potion bottles that were heard/seen clattering around.

If the party decides to trail Groubun, they will be lead to the Day's Rest.
Using the earrings, they might delegate a trail party and have the other members catch up.
Have the group roll a group check:

- (Stealth, DC 12) The pursuing group does not draw the attention of Groubun. If failed: Groubun will notice the group pursuing him but not react - he will tip off the Piranhas gang though that there may be heightened security the following day.

## Next Scenes

If the party chose to tail Groubun, they will go to 05 - the day's rest at night.
Otherwise, skip to the next day's events in 06 - the planted cargo.
