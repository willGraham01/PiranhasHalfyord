# The Market Attack

## Setting

The adventure begins with the party - either as a collective or individuals - present in Halfyord's great market.
It is mid-afternoon and the square is busy with the afternoon business spike, before it dies down during the evening.
A number of merchants have their wares laid out on movable carts, or rugs and blankets on the ground.
A few wealthier merchants have what looks to be hired protection for themselves or their wares, and there are a few guards posted at the square's entrances.
Amongst the shoppers are members of the Shattered Teeth gang, ready to spring their latest plan into action.

## If the party does not know each other

If the player characters do no know each other yet, have them explain what their character might be doing in the market square.
Are they just passing through by chance?
Are they shopping for a souvenir, keepsake, or particular item?
Are they assisting the temple, or busking, etc.

The players do not need to be together for the beginning of the adventure, but all need a reason to be drawn into the action.
If possible, try to tie the start of the heist into the activity that one of the player characters is performing.

## The Heist

Three shattered teeth gang members will be present in the crowd.
They will each approach an upper-end merchant stand; such as a jeweller or silks merchant, etc.
When one of them gives the signal, they will each drop their potion of animating on the ground, shattering it and animating the kiosk's goods.
If confronted early, the gang members will spring the heist early on whatever is nearby, and attempt to cover their tracks.

- Perception 15 (passive): The PC notices the three gang members enter together and then split up to separate kiosks.
- Perception 10 (advantage: character is bartering with a merchant): The PC notices raised voices, or the presence of a gang member near their stool acting unusually.

The potions will animate the goods of the merchants who were chosen as victims.
The objective of the gang is to transport as many of these goods back to their base as possible, however first and foremost they don't want to be tracked down themselves.
In the interest of advancing the plot, is may be prudent to allow at least one gang member to be killed or incapacitated during this fight, so they party can inspect the corpse for the Shattered Teeth necklace.
After the death of one member, the other gang members will attempt to flee the scene - allow them to do this and use the animated wolves as cover to prevent a pursuit.

Other encounter effects:

- The market crowd will scatter when the animated wolves appear. Assume that the crowd acts first in combat and uses their action to move away from the scene, allowing freedom of movement. The merchant victims and their hirelings will also attempt to move to minimum safe distance.
- After a couple of PCs have gone in combat, the alarm bell will be raised by one of the on-duty guards. Mention that it starts to toll.
- After one round of combat, Shufharz and a garrison of nearby troops will be seen rushing down the main street from the barracks. They will arrive the following round. The gang members and loot wolves will shift focus to getting away when this happens.
