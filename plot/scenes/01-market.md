# The Market Attack

## Setting

The adventure begins with the party - either as a collective or individuals - present in Halfyord's great market.
It is mid-afternoon and the square is busy with the afternoon business spike, before it dies down during the evening.
There is the faint sound of dockworkers and ships, alongside gulls and other waterfowl, coming from the docks.
A number of merchants have their wares laid out on movable carts, or rugs and blankets on the ground.
A few wealthier merchants have what looks to be hired protection for themselves or their wares, and there are a few guards posted at the square's entrances.
Amongst the shoppers are members of the Shattered Teeth gang, ready to spring their latest plan into action.

## If the party does not know each other

If the player characters do no know each other yet, have them explain what their character might be doing in the market square.
Are they just passing through by chance?
Are they shopping for a souvenir, keepsake, or particular item?
Are they assisting the temple, or busking, etc.

The players do not need to be together for the beginning of the adventure, but all need a reason to be drawn into the action.
If possible, try to tie the start of the heist into the activity that one of the player characters is performing.

## The Heist

Three shattered teeth gang members will be present in the crowd.
They will each approach an upper-end merchant stand; such as a jeweller or silks merchant, etc.
When one of them gives the signal, they will each drop their potion of animating on the ground, shattering it and animating the kiosk's goods.
If the kiosk has a guard, they can also be seen to smear a powder into their faces, which will turn out to be a sleeping draught.
If confronted early, the gang members will spring the heist early on whatever is nearby, and attempt to cover their tracks.

- (Perception 15 - PASSIVE): The PC notices the three gang members enter together and then split up to separate kiosks.
- (Perception 10 - ADV: character is bartering with a merchant): The PC notices raised voices, or the presence of a gang member near their stool acting unusually.

The potions will animate the goods of the merchants who were chosen as victims.
The objective of the gang is to transport as many of these goods back to their base as possible, however first and foremost they don't want to be tracked down themselves.
In the interest of advancing the plot, is may be prudent to allow at least one gang member to be killed or incapacitated during this fight, so they party can inspect the corpse for the Shattered Teeth necklace.
After the death of one member, the other gang members will attempt to flee the scene - allow them to do this and use the animated wolves as cover to prevent a pursuit.

### Combat Encounter

See [the market combat encounter](../../combats/market.md).

## Aftermath of the Attack

Shufharz should arrive before the party sustains any casualties, and the gang is not looking to _inflict_ any on the party.
If anyone is close to dying, one of Shufharz' men will be trained in first aid, and a priest from the temple will be in the square to stabilise the party member.

Shufharz will question the party on what they saw.
The market will be declared a crime scene, but the party will be allowed to investigate the nearby vicinity so long as they are upfront with Shufharz.
The guard escort will begin to close the market and encourage people along though - at this point any merchants whose goods were saved will be thanking the party too.
Otherwise, they will be brask with Shufharz and may even mention that this isn't the first they've heard of these "attacks" and why the town guard can't deal with it.

Possible discoveries that the party might make here include:

- (AUTO) Necklace(s) recovered from any killed or captured gang members.
- (Investigation 10) The sleeping powder substance used by the gang members. (Arcana 10 / Survival 15) to identify it as a sleeping draught.
- (Survival 15) The general direction of the escaping loot wolves and gang members. (20) Gang members can be tracked to the bridge across town, and a necklace will be dropped on the route if not already recovered.
- (Perception 15) To notice that the sewer grate in the corner of the market has now been torn off.
- (Arcana 15 - ADV: Detect Magic, AUTO: Identify spell) To identify any residual magic on the animated goods that were saved. (20) This effect came from a potion, not an innate casting of magic, suggesting the user themselves does not possess any magical talent.
- (Persuasion 10 - DIS: Not all the loot was saved & asking a merchant) To get a reward from either Shufharz or a merchant for intervening. The reward will be a discount at the blacksmith's either by them being a friend of the merchant or on orders of Shufharz.

After her initial investigation, Shufharz will take stock of the situation (and may be accosted by concerned merchants).
Shufharz will express an interest in the party helping them with the gang problem if they performed well during the combat - otherwise her request for their help will come across as desperate.
Regardless, she will promise a reward for helping and more information if the party comes with her to the magistrate's office, where they can speak privately.

## Next Scenes

The party should proceed to 02 - the magistrates office after this scene.
