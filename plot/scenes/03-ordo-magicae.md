# The Ordo Magicae

The party can arrive at the Ordo Magicae at two different times; either after having scoped out the docks with Shufharz or heading there directly from the magistrate's office, before visiting the docks.

## Arriving from the Magistrate's Office

The party will arrive to find Jenessa preparing to close up the shop that runs from the ground floor of the Ordo.
Groubun will be in the lab - officially working on experiments but in reality putting the finishing touches on some more potions for the heist tomorrow, which he is planning to deliver to the Piranhas tonight.
The other Ordo staff members are absent, save for one who is taking a break in the living area on the middle floor of the building.

Jenessa will greet them as if they were customers when they enter the lobby, explaining that the shop is closed for the day and making an offhand comment that "there isn't much to browse anyway".
Once the party reveals they are working with Shufharz, she will open up slightly and properly close up the shop.
If asked for details about the Ordo, she will share information about the outpost's purpose, organisational structure, staff, and current supply problems.
She will ask if the party intends to aid Shufharz in finding Faire, and will offer the following details about his disappearance if prompted:

- She last saw him & Groubun working in the lab around noon on the day he disappeared. Jenessa herself had closed the shop up early to pick up an order from the Herbalist (which the Herbalist will confirm, should the party stop by there).
- Faire was not present in the building when she returned. Groubun was upstairs in his study, working on a research paper related to their experiment earlier in the day. Groubun claimed that Faire had left around 13:00 to attend a meeting with the city officials.

Jenessa will also offer some insight into the reality of Faire's position and abilities:

- She is aware that Faire's "promotion" was more a curse than a blessing
- She is aware that Faire is past his prime in terms of research, and that Groubun is the real brains behind the outpost's research
- She will give off the impression that this is not an unusual occurrence in the Ordo, and that she has worked through such a situation more than once.
- (Insight, DC 10) Jenessa's body language implies that Faire has been a particularly bad appointment.
- (Persuasion, DC 15) Jenessa will reveal the above information through speech, if asked.

Once the initial conversation is over, the party should raise the topic of the assistance that Shufharz is expecting.
If they don't, Jenessa can remind herself and move the scene along.

### The Lab

Jenessa's item will be in the lab, where Groubun is currently working.
Jenessa will remind that party that Groubun isn't in on Shufharz' plan for tomorrow due to how busy he has been as acting Ordinator, but she will also say there is likely no harm if this fact lets slip to him tonight.

Upon entering the lab, Groubun will be distilling some sort of potion and have a couple of bottles already prepared.
On a desk with the completed bottles will be his research log - this will be open on the page with the design for the anti-magic collar that Faire is currently being forced to wear.
The shelves around the lab will contain a large number of empty jars and bottles, as if supply is short.
The only ingredients in abundance are those that Groubun uses to make his polymorph / animate objects potions, which he gets from the Piranhas.
Faire's workstation is a cluttered mess of papers, books, and partially cleaned flasks and other containers.

Groubun will notice the party's entry and greet them cordially, and Jenessa will explain they're just here to pick up a delivery.
The party will have the option to speak to Groubun in the lab, and he will share the following information:

- His version of events leading up to Faire's disappearance. This will align with the version of events given by Jenessa, but of course whilst Jenessa was out, Groubun administered the polymorph potion and delivered cat-Faire to the Day's Rest.
- He will be more forthcoming about Faire's research abilities and skills as Ordinator.
- (Insight, DC 15) A character will pick up on the disdain that Groubun has when talking about Faire as his supervisor.
- (Persuasion, DC 15) Groubun can be convinced to share the information that Faire has essentially been leaning in on him for any kind of research output.
- He will also outline the supply problems the Ordo is now facing.

The party might ask Groubun what he is brewing, and at first Groubun will be defensive about it (albeit in a cordial manner) and lie that it is a batch of healing salves for the temple.

- (Investigation, DC 20) (Arcana, DC 15) (Detect Magic / Identify) Upon inspection, the potions produced do not appear to give off the magical essence typically associated with healing potions.
- If Groubun is confronted with the above assessment, he will smirk slightly (as if in appreciation for knowledge) and confirm the character's investigation. He'll go on to say that these salves instead work by physically stitching and morphing the body to repair itself, rather than the "usual" healing method of revitalising the body.
- A character can try to examine Groubun's notebook, where they will see design for the anitmagic collar. (Stealth, DC 15, DIS: Groubun is not engaged in conversation) Groubun notices the character doing this and gets defensive, claiming that the research in his notebook has yet to be published and to not get any ideas. This will trigger his early exit from the scene. If a character passes the stealth check and openly asks Groubun about the design, he will still get defensive but will play off the character's ignorance in not knowing it was groundbreaking research. He will still leave the scene early.

Groubun will finish his brewing whilst the party is in conversation with him, and will make an excuse to leave with his potions and his notebook - something about doing a stock take and writing up the results of today's experiments.
When he leaves Jenessa will remark that he's under a lot of pressure but has taken on the role of acting Ordinator very well, and how amazed she is that he still finds time for his research with all these extra duties.
In reality, Groubun is heading upstairs to prepare to ship the potions over to the Day's Rest, and is just looking for a satchel bag to place them in.
In his haste, he will forget to pick up the supply logbook from the other side of the lab, which the players might take notice of.

Once Groubun leaves, Jenessa will have retrieved her item.
The players might choose to ask her about the supply situation or various pieces of apparatus in the lab, before or after she explains her item.

- (Investigation / Perception DC 10) A character notices that all the shelves bar a particular selection of alchemical supplies are almost out of stock, or are out of stock entirely.
- Jenessa can be asked about this situation, and she will agree that's a good point and will explain it offhand with something like "these are likely specialise ingredients that can't be used without more common reagents". Essentially believing that this is just some old stock that hasn't hand any use since the more basic supplies began to run out.
- (Investigation DC 17 / Arcana DC 12) A character notices that Groubun left an empty petri dish / syringe next to his brewing equipment that contains traces of these abundant ingredients. (Nature DC 15 / Survival DC 20) will identify the ingredients as having the polymorph-esque effects that Groubun claimed he was imbuing into the potions, but also highlight the animation properties of the ingredients too.
- A character can ask Jenessa if there is a logbook of the Ordo's supplies, or (Investigation DC 5) look for it in the lab. The logbook will contradict the current state of supplies - claiming there should be almost nothing in stock. Jenessa will be confused at this revelation but put it down to Faire's poor stocktaking and his disappearance likely preventing him from logging a delivery.
- A character can inspect Faire's desk for clues about his disappearance. Inspecting his notebook will reveal that most of what's written is nonsense or garbage, with a very very speculative ideas that have no real applications. (Investigation DC 17) The character notices a coffee cup that appears to have been used as a container for an ingredient. If the party has already noted which ingredients are in abundance in the lab, the character can identify it in the same way as Groubun's petri dish. This is how Groubun administered the polymorph potion.
- (Persuasion DC 12) Jenessa can be convinced to part with 2 potions of minor healing (2d4+4) if the party convinces her that they will be in the firing line for the heist tomorrow.

## Jenessa's Item

Jenessa will give the party the Ring of Seeking and explain how it works.
She can also recharge it for them if they need this done, however the course of the story should mean that the party can do without recharging the ring (or if it is used at the docks or the Day's Rest, can be recharged with any remaining spell slots overnight).
After answering any more questions the party might have, she will excuse herself and show the party out of the building.

## Arriving after visting the docks

If the players arrive after visiting the docks with Shufharz, things will play out slightly differently.
Groubun will not be present in the lab, having already gone upstairs to prepare for the delivery to the Day's Rest, so the party will loose the opportunity to interact with him.
Jenessa will take a moment to answer the door, herself being upstairs in the living area having closed the shop sooner.
Groubun's notebook will not be present in the lab either, however the other evidence will be.

Once the party receives Jenessa's ring, Groubun will come down the stairs to leave for the Day's Rest.
He won't stop to engage the party in conversation, and will make the excuse that he is heading to the temple with a delivery (to explain the satchel he is carrying).

- (Insight DC 15) Something about the manner in which Groubun says he's going to the temple doesn't sit quite right (it's very late, why not make the delivery in the day when it's likely needed more, for example).

The party will have the option to tail Groubun from the Ordo to the Day's Rest as detailed in scene 04 - the docks at night.
The same mechanics are applicable, however Groubun will not automatically be suspicious of the party like if he catches them at the docks after seeing them at the outpost.
If he notices them tailing him, he will of course alert Fordem and the gang when he arrives.

## Opportunities for further investigation

To allow additional "fail-safe" checks for the party in case they miss anything in their investigation, the upper floors of the Ordo will be unguarded so a sneaky character might be able to slip away.
The party might also come back to the Ordo after reaching the Day's Rest and ask around for Groubun, or again poke around in his things.

If the rest of the Ordo is explored, allow the players appropriate checks to discover anything they might have missed, and other useful insights like:

- The Ordo role succession rules.
- Recent Groubun and Faire publications.
- Documents in Faire's room that indicate he is neglecting his duties, and struggling for inspiration.
- Letters from Groubun's family asking about his career.
- Jenessa may keep a journal that provides more insight than she is willing to speak.
- Groubun's room will also contain a spare key for Faire's cat-collar.

## Next Scenes

The party should head to 04 - the docks at night if they have not met with Shufharz yet.
Otherwise, they can proceed to 05 - the day's rest at night if they chose to follow Groubun.
Finally, they may choose to not follow Groubun after coming from the docks, in which case they can proceed to 06 - the planted cargo.
