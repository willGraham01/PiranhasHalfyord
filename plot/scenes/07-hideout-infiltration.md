# Infiltrating the Hideout

The party will be left with no other options other than to attempt to follow the trail into the gang's hideout.
The two ways into the hideout are via the Day's Rest cellar, and through the manhole in the back alley.

## Entering via the Manhole

The manhole entrance is always available, and will allow the party to bypass the first few rooms in the hideout.
However the party will only know of this entrance if they manage to track a piece of the animated cargo very carefully from the docks, and are not delayed by the other happenings on.
Alternatively, the party might deliberately look for a back entrance if they strongly suspect something is up with the tavern - allow investigation checks to discover the entrance, but this is very hard without context clues.

If the party does enter via the manhole, have Whiskers join them before the go in (if he is not with them already).
Skip ahead to the "vault" section of the hideout.

## Entering via the Cellar

If they were suitably delayed at the docks, the party will likely arrive at the Day's Rest once the gang members and the "loot" from the docks has already arrived.
Hope will be present and on cleaning duty prior to the tavern's opening hours later this evening.
Whiskers, if not adopted, will also join the party at this point.

If the animated cargo was prevented from taking the sewers to the hideout, then have a single animated loot wolf be present in the tavern.
It will have backed Hope into the kitchen (what it is actually trying to do is enter the cellar, but is unable to do so hence is waiting idly), and she will naturally be terrified.
The party should be able to dispatch the animated wolf quickly, or if they leave it up and open the cellar it will provide some more context clues in the next few scenes.

If the cargo managed to get to the hideout via the sewers, Hope will just be performing her cleaning duties and will be surprised to have the door open and the party burst in.
She may recognise some of them from the night before, and will be helpful in answering any questions they have but is oblivious to the criminal hideout underground.
If the party asks a lot of questions, have her answers veer more towards "I don't know" or "you'll have to ask Fordem", which should raise the topic of where he is.
Hope will pause for a moment at this, then conclude that the last time she saw him today he was checking the stores in the cellar.
If pressed for how recently, the amount of time she gives should be suitable length to indicate Fordem was absent from the tavern (IE in the hideout) about an hour or so prior to the cargo-heist starting.

Hope has a key to the cellar on her, which she can be convinced to use to open the cellar.
Whiskers can also draw attention to the cellar door by scratching on the woodwork.

- (Investigation DC 10) The cellar is locked, but Hope says Fordem was last seen down there.
- (Investigation DC 20) If generally searching the bar/kitchen area, one of the gang's covert marks will be discovered indicating a direction towards the cellar trap door. It will have to be interpreted like the others at the bridge by a character who speaks Thieves' Cant.
- (Strength DC 15) The cellar trapdoor can be forced open, damaging it in the process.
- (Thieves' tools DC 20) The cellar can be lock-picked open.

Once the cellar door is open, the animated wolf (if present) will immediately dive down into the cellar, ignoring the party and Hope.

## The Cellar

At this point, the party enters the hideout map.
Whiskers will come down into the cellar with the party, but Hope will refuse to join the group.
If alive, the loot wolf will be staring at the hollow wall that opens up to the hideout.
There are no lit light sources in the room - the party will need darkvision to see properly.

In the cellar will be a lot of barrels containing - presumably - beer and other assorted alcohol.
There is splintered wood and scratch marks on the stone floor near the wall opposite the stairs, in front of the hollow wall.
The hollow wall also has a number of smaller barrels (that are almost empty) blocking direct access to it.
On the wall to the left of the stairs are barrels that genuinely contain alcohol, but also contain some ingredients that the party might recognise as valuable alchemical ingredients / spell components.
Behind this cluster of barrels is another gang sign, next to a loose brick that acts as a switch and opens the hollow wall.

The party should hopefully begin investigating and looking for a way forwards; with the following information available through checks:

- (Strength, DC 10 ADV: Crowbar or other suitable tool) To open any of the barrels on this floor.
- (Strength, DC 15 ADV: Two party members work together) To move the smaller barrels along the floor.
- (Investigation DC 13 / Perception PASSIVE DC 13) A character notices the scratch marks and wood splinters on the floor.
- (Nature / Perception DC 16, Arcana DC 18) A character notices an odd smell - not associated with alcohol - coming from the larger barrels. Can also be used to identify the substances as those that were in abundance at the Ordo if the barrels are opened.
- (Investigation DC 15 ADV: A gang symbol has been previously identified) To notice the marking on the wall, near the lever. Further investigation will reveal the loose brick.
- (Investigation / Perception DC 14 ADV: Tapping the walls for hollow spots or loose bricks) Tapping along the walls identifies the hollow wall. If the character is not tapping along the walls, they might instead notice faint slits of light creeping through the stonework near the hollow wall, which is odd because they are underground and not outward-facing.
- (Strength DC 20) The hollow wall can be broken down. This is LOUD.

Allow other methods for discover of a way forward or ingenuity - using explosives to break down the walls for example by igniting the alcoholic barrels.
Just make sure to note if the entry method the party chooses is LOUD, and/or destabilising to the structure of the building.

Whiskers can be used to provide context clues.
If the party is genuinely stuck, have them move a barrel which reveals a cat-sized hole.
Whiskers (or a druid party member) can then go through the hole and open the hollow door from the inside.

## Hideout Recreational Area

Going through the wall will place the party in the gathering hall that the gang has underground.
This area will be well-lit and most likely populated by gang members, unless they were all apprehended at the docks.
There are two further exits on either side of the far side of the room, both with closed doors.
Immediately in front of the wall-door is a desk and a makeshift supply dump that the gang has been using for their magical items and potions.
There is a logbook on the desk which details which materials are assigned to who, for which heists or missions - note that the cargo heist today is listed as the last entry on the board.
The centre of the room is taken up by a recreation area - there are rugs and cushions to form a seating area, and a table with cards and games left out.
There is a notice board on the wall just beside the "games" table which has gang announcements of sorts.
In particular, there will be a "next delivery exchange" note which may incriminate Groubun.
The far end of the room has a table that's used as an eatery, and an unkempt bookshelf.

Taking the door at the far end of the room, on the same wall as that which leads to the cellar, will take the party to the lodgings.
There are several beds in here, a few weapon racks with various items missing or mislaid, some spare plain clothes in wardrobes, and a number of silver-tooth necklaces similar to those that the party might have recovered from gang members they've encountered before.

The door opposite to the lodgings is reinforced, and leads into a log corridor lit by scones.
At the end of the corridor there are two sets of doors facing each other.

### Populated

If the party gained access to the hideout in a LOUD way, Carlton and Fordem will have joined the rest of the gang members in the recreational area.
The gang members in the lodging room will also be present immediately, rather than absent from the main room.
If this is the case, use the notes in the "encounter with Carlton" section - the resulting fight will play out slightly differently due to the distance to the vault and change of scenery, but otherwise can take place here.

Otherwise, only the gang members who made it back from the heist will be present in the hideout, along with 2 gang members who will be at the table playing cards.
There will also be at least one gang member in the lodging room, partially dressed.
If an animated wolf was in the cellar, it will immediately head through the wall and towards the vault.
Have the gang members exclaim in shock, but do not blow the party's cover yet - have them exclaim their surprise or why the back entrance was not used instead.

- (Stealth DC 15 GROUP) The party's use of the hollow wall and subsequent entry does not alert the gang members playing cards. Put this down to EG the gang members both sitting at chairs that face away from the entrance, or be in the middle of a discussion.

There is more evidence that the party can gather in this room.
If the gang members have not been dealt with, moving around the room will require stealth checks.

- (Perception DC 15) If the gang members are not alerted, they can be eavesdropped on. Most of their conversation will be mundane, but they will also talk about today's heist. One will mention Groubun's visit last night (only referring to him as "the dwarf"). Another might mention that the others have been gone longer than expected.
- (Investigation / Nature / Survival / Arcana DC 10) The supply shelf can be investigated to reveal potions very similar in substance and appearance to those Groubun was creating last night. Detect magic or Identify can also provide this information.
- The logbook on the desk can be read for evidence. A character will notice that someone was in the process of copying from one book into the other, but notices that the incomplete book has Faire's name in it, whilst the complete one just has "G".
- The notice board near the table with cards will have the delivery notice on it, again with a "G" in place of an actual name.
- (Investigation DC 10) Looking through the lodgings room will reveal a cat-carry cage in one of the corners of the room.

If the gang members are alerted here, then use the "hideout rec room" encounter for guidance.
Importantly, if the party gets into a fight here, having not ENTERED in a loud manner, do not have Carlton and Fordem join the fight.
But do have Fordem be seen ducking into Carlton's study when the party moves into the corridor towards the vault.

## The Corridor

Exiting the recreational room via the door opposite the lodging area will open into a narrow corridor.
If a fight broke out in the recreational area, have whichever party member opened the door notice Fordem at the far end of the corridor taking a key out of the vault door.
Fordem will see the party and duck into Carlton's room (the door will not be locked though).

Proceeding down the corridor is harmless, though the party might be weary of traps.
The two doors at the far end of the corridor lead to either Carlton's study or the vault.

The vault door has a heavy lock and iron bars across.
The other door is again reinforced but unlocked and leads to Carlton's planning room, and a door further in to his private room.

Unlocking the vault without Fordem's key is a very hard check (Thieves' Tools, DC 25).
A failed attempt will cause a loud, shrilling sounds to be emitted from the door and force anyone in the vicinity to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, a character takes 1d6+2 psychic damage and has a nasty headache.

## The Vault

Inside the vault are most of the valuables that the gang has managed to steal since Groubun begun assisting them.
Any animated wolves that made it from the docks will be standing idly in the room, they will not react to the party's entry.
If the party manages to infiltrate the sewers they will enter directly into the vault (from the "ceiling") - they will be able to lift the lock on the vault from the inside without issue, and the alarm will not sound in this case.

There is a small fortune stored in the vault, however the party should be aware that Kamonas and Shufharz are looking to reclaim most of the wealth the gang has stolen thus far.
Allow them to line their pockets with a few gold coins (2d6+1) each, however if they attempt to take more, have the animated wolves turn on them.
The wolves turning on them will also trip the alarm if it was not triggered already.

If the alarm goes off and the party entered via the sewers, have all gang members (including Carlton and Fordem) open the vault door to confront the party once combat with the wolves ends.
If the alarm goes off and the party has made their way through the hideout, have Carlton call out to the party from his study to entice them into conversation and the final encounter.
If they don't take the bait, have him and Fordem move out to confront them - with the animated bear already up.

## Carlton's HQ

Assuming Carlton and Fordem are still in his HQ, the party will need to open the door to trigger the final confrontation.
The door itself will not be locked, nor is it trapped - the party can just walk in.
When they open the door, Carlton will be sitting at the desk directly ahead of them, and Fordem will be standing nearby with his weapon drawn.
Carlton will attempt to engage the group in dialogue (provided they did not ready any hostile actions, which will skip to the combat).

Carlton will attempt to negotiate his freedom; he still has a few tricks up his sleeve, but he is also aware that he has little in the way of bargaining chips.
He will begin by offering up Faire's location - and the collar-key that he keeps around his neck.
The party might have already deduced that Whiskers is Faire by this point though, in which case Carlton will offer to spill the beans on the entire operation with Groubun, again in exchange for his freedom.
Carlton cannot be convinced to turn himself in - Fordem however can be persuaded to take the fall for Carlton (and potentially even testify against Groubun).
Fordem will not give himself up though, unless Carlton's negotiations fail.
The following conversation paths are available:

- Carlton's opening greetings and exchanges. It will culminate with Carlton asking why the group is here / is so motivated.
- Carlton will offer up information about Faire in exchange for his freedom.
  - The party can reject this offer.
  - The party can demand Carlton still come with them, rather than being killed in his hideout. Carlton will reject this offer, but Fordem will step in to throw himself under the bus. (Persuasion, DC20) Fordem can be convinced to take the fall for Carlton, and Carlton goes free.
- Carlton offers up information about the operation with Groubun.
  - The options are identical to the earlier offer to Faire.
- Having exhausted all his options, Carlton will initiate combat.

Use the ["encounter with Carlton"](../../combats/carlton.md) combat for the final confrontation.

### Loot

Once the fight is over, the party can loot the HQ and the bodies of Carlton and Fordem for valuables.

- Carlton's desk has a master key for the hideout and cellar. It also has a number of papers that incriminate Groubun, including instructions for the use of the collar and the runic key to unlock it.
- Carlton's room has further loot:
  - The bedside table has the collar key on it.
    - Inside the chest of draws is a potion. (Arcana DC 10 / Identify / Detect magic) it is a potion of dispelling (this can be used to restore Faire to elf form).
  - The chest contains some nice clothes, a few gems, and a coin pouch.
    - Gems: (party size * 2) pearls worth 25GP each.
    - Coins: (party size)d4s gold pieces are found.
    - Clothes: A shirt of mending can be found in the chest.
  - The weapon rack has a rapier and a shortsword that can be taken.

Once the party is finished, move into the conclusions scenes.
