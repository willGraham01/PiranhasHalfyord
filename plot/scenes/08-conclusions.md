# Conclusions and Wrap-Up

The party will reach this point of the story after confronting Carlton and Fordem.
The outstanding objectives (not all of which may be known to the party) are:

- Restoring Faire to elf form / locating Faire or a clue to his whereabouts.
- Reporting back to Shufharz, possibly with Carlton and/or Fordem apprehended.
- Apprehending Groubun.

## Restoring Faire

After dealing with Carlton (and possibly searching the room) the party should have one of the keys to the collar that Whiskers is wearing.
They should also find a potion of dispelling in Carlton's chest of draws, which they can administer to Whiskers at any point.

The party might not know that Whiskers is Faire if they didn't listen to Carlton, nor have any suspicions from interacting with Whiskers the night before.
If so, they might not think to administer the potion to Whiskers, but since he should be with them at the hideout he can attempt to cat-like claw at the potion bottle when he sees it.
Whisker's collar needs to be removed for the potion to take effect - if the party does not think to remove the collar, then Faire is in for a lifetime as a cat, and there is not much else that can be done.
Give the party an opportunity to recognise the collar's significance when it comes to apprehending Groubun, so that they have another attempt to find Faire.

Once restored, Faire will join the party and accompany them to report back to Shufharz and Kamonas.
Whilst he is with the party, they can attempt to make use of his skills as a wizard, though refer to Faire's statblock which reflects that he's past his prime.
He will also obviously fill in his side of the story; and in particular spill the beans on Groubun.
Faire will want to report to Shufharz before going back to the order, and will be outraged if the party suggests another course of action.

## Reporting back to Shufharz

The party can regroup with Shufharz at the docks, who will be dealing with the aftermath of the heist.
Kamonas will also be present with an escort, and in conversation with Shufharz when the party arrives.
There are multiple things that the party can report, but the key information and next steps that will be suggested are:

- The fate of Carlton and the gang.
  - If Carlton was killed and the party has evidence (his necklace, hideout location, Faire, etc) then Shufharz and Kamonas will be pleased.
  - If Carlton was captured and has been bought to them, act as if he had been killed with evidence.
  - If Fordem is impersonating Carlton, the party will need to succeed on a DC 20 deception check against Shufharz. Kamonas will still be happy and interject before Shufharz can complain too much, since the gang has been dealt with - even if not in the manner Shufharz would have liked.
- The Ordo's leadership.
  - If Faire is with the group, he will insist that they head to the Ordo and arrest Groubun.
  - If Whiskers is still present, but the party has sufficient evidence to incriminate Groubun, then Shufharz will suggest they head to the Ordo to apprehend Groubun whilst any prisoners are escorted to the prison.
  - If the party has failed to glean any solid evidence against Groubun, _and_ failed to suspect Whisker's true nature, then Groubun will continue as the leader of the Ordo. Do not head to the "apprehending Groubun" scene.

## Apprehending Groubun

The only loose end in the story is Groubun at the Ordo.
The party should head here after reporting back to Shufharz and Kamonas at the docks, and Shufharz, Kamonas, and Faire / Whiskers should be present too.
Whether Groubun is present at the Ordo depends on whether he got suspicious the night before.

If Groubun became suspicious of the party the previous evening, he will have left shortly after the heist backfired.
The party and their escorts will arrive at the Ordo to find it open as usual and Jenessa at the shop front desk.
Jenessa will be surprised to see Faire (if he is present), and when asked if Groubun is here will report that he recently left and gave a vague reason.
She will be taken aback by any revelations that the party shares with her.
In this ending, Groubun will have escaped.

If Groubun was not suspicious the previous evening, he will be working in the lab as normal.
Jenessa will allow the party access to the lab in this case, where one final confrontation with Groubun awaits.
The party has a chance to learn the complete story in a confession from Groubun at this point - if Faire is with the party then he will know the jig is up.
Any member of the party can attempt to convince Groubun to surrender peacefully (Persuasion / Intimidation DC 10, ADV: Faire or Shufharz is present).
If this attempt fails, Groubun will attempt to flee by knocking over some apparatus in the lab to create a fog cloud and sprinting for the door.
In this case, allow the party members to each make a contested athletics check (at disadvantage) against Groubun's acrobatics or athletics to see if they can intercept him as he runs for the door.
If the party fails, the can still get one more chance to stop him before he reaches the door downstairs - allow any appropriate actions to be taken here.
Once outside the Ordo, Groubun will pull out a scroll of Dimension Door and vanish, having once again escaped.

If Groubun is apprehended, the Ordo will contribute to the party's reward at the conclusion.

## Conclusion

For successfully ending the threat of the Piranhas, Kamonas will reward the party with ownership of the Day's Rest tavern.
She will claim that the town treasury is in anarchy (and will be for some time) due to recent events, and hopes that this will be ample compensation for the party in absence of this.
The party can choose whether or not Hope remains an employee of the tavern - the idea is that she can act as a caretaker for the party when they are out exploring and an otherwise useful NPC for the DM to have!

If Shufharz is convinced that the Piranhas are truly dealt with, she will reward the party with the bounty that was on Carlton's head.
The party will be given 200GP to split at their discretion.

If the Ordo leadership crisis was resolved, Jenessa will reward the party with a ring of spell storing (2nd level).

Any other magic items that the party was provided for the investigation will be repossessed by Shufharz (earrings of message) and Jenessa (ring of seeking).
