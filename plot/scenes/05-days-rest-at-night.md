# The Day's Rest (night)

The party may follow Groubun on his journey through the streets if they spot him at the docks, or if he leaves in a hurry from the Ordo outpost.
It will quickly become apparent that he is not heading to the temple (the only plausible location if he previously gave his "healing salve" excuse), and will lead the party to the Day's Rest tavern.

## On Arrival

The tavern is on a street corner so the party will see Groubun enter as they tail from a distance.
There will be a gang member on the door as a bouncer who will immediately wave Groubun in.
Once inside, Groubun will head directly to the bar and wait for service from Fordem.

If the party is following Groubun, they will have to walk past the bouncer to get into the tavern.
He will not stop them, however will greet them as they approach and ask them to declare their weapons, etc.
He will not take anything off them, but is essentially making it seem like a routine thing.

- (Insight / Perception DC 13) The players notice the bouncer quickly glancing inside to check with Fordem if it's OK to let more people in.

It's the end of a working day and the tavern is busy.
Most tables are full with patrons, a mixture of the local populace and any tourists that are renting rooms.
There is some seating at the bar - Groubun will be at one such stool, and Fordem will be serving.
The mezzanine level will have a live band playing, whilst on the main floor Hope will be serving drinks and food.
The kitchen staff will be in the kitchen, and Faire (in cat form) will be walking around in his usual plight.

There are several things that the party might choose to do:

- (Intimidation / Persuasion / Deception / Performance DC 10) There is a small table of patrons who look like they have been at the end of the their drinks for a while. A successful check will free up the table to pose as patrons.
- (Perception DC 15, ADV: at the bar) A character can notice Groubun at the bar, talking to the bartender (Fordem).
- Other attempts to blend in might be to join the game of cards going on at one table, or to head up to the mezzanine level to "enjoy" the music.
- (Stealth DC 15, DIS: Groubun noticed the party's pursuit) Ordering a drink from the bar does not alert Groubun to the party's presence.
- If the party elects to confront Groubun, he will claim to be visiting Fordem (on his way to the temple, if the bottles are questioned). Fordem will come across to "save" him a short way into this conversation, and attempt to lead him into the kitchen to later get him into the cellar. Interacting directly with Groubun in any way increases the gang's presence at the heist tomorrow.

## Whiskers the Cat

If the party seats themselves and watches Groubun, after a short while Faire will jump onto the bar and start hit usual hissing and bottle pushing.
This activity can also be used as an escape for Groubun if a character has decided to confront him.
Fordem will attempt to grab Faire to stop him from causing more damage (mimic a check to grab the cat) but Faire will be too quick and jump onto the tavern floor.
Fordem will shout for Hope to get the cat under control, and lead Groubun away from the bar.

- (Athletics / Sleight of Hand, CONTESTED: Faire's acrobatics) A character can meander through the busy tavern to catch Faire before Hope does.

If no-one from the party manages or tries to catch Faire, Hope will try to catch him and will be successful after a minute or two.
Local patrons will laugh, and if Faire stops on a table they will try to pet him.
If the party didn't try to catch Faire, have him run to wherever the party has based themselves, so Hope can catch up to him there.

- (Athletics / Sleight of Hand, CONTESTED: Faire's acrobatics) The party manages to protect their drinks from the marauding cat.

Hope will apologise to the party when she catches up to Faire.
Faire will take a liking to the party, in particular the character who is wearing Jenessa's ring (if any).
Now that Faire is close, the party members might notice:

- The antimagic collar he is wearing. (Arcana DC 15, ADV: The design was noted in the Ordo) To identify it as being similar if not identical to the design Groubun had in the lab.
- (Animal Handling DC 15) Faire's movements seem to be slightly janky for a cat, if such a thing is possible. He's agile, but doesn't seem to settle on the table like a normal cat does for example. Over time, a character might notice he doesn't groom himself either.

Hope will arrive to take care of Faire and apologise to the party if their drinks are spilled.
She'll remark that he's still getting used to his new home, and so is she to being a pet owner.
She will call Faire "Whiskers", not knowing his true nature.
The party might ask for more information, which she'll happily provide:

- Fordem found "Whiskers" out by the bins a couple of weeks ago.
- Since then, he's taken a liking to Hope but has refused to get along with Fordem.
- If asked about the collar, Hope will mention that Fordem had his friend from the "magic outpost" make it. Fordem said it was to make sure that they could keep track of Whisker's location and to make sure he stayed in the tavern. She'll reveal a small necklace that has a spherical bauble on it, about the size of a marble - there will be a small blue dot in the location of "Whiskers". Fordem has an identical copy. She'll also explain that the collar keeps Whiskers near the tavern at all times.

Hope is genuinely ignorant of Whisker's true nature and the gang using the tavern as a hideout. She'll happily talk about herself if asked, but otherwise will go back to serving.
Once Hope leaves, the party can continue to interact with Whiskers, but the antimagic collar will prevent any beneficial spell-casting.

- (Arcana DC 25, REQ: Dispel magic) The antimagic collar is dispelled.
- If attempting to cast a spell on Whiskers unsuccessfully - the collar's runes appear to glow, then fade as the magic dissipates. "Whiskers" will react excitedly, almost hopeful.
- (Arcana DC 15, Auto: Identify spell) The collar appears to do more than what Hope has said it does, appearing to shield Whiskers from most external magic sources.

## Groubun's Disappearance

Whilst the party interacts with Hope and "Whiskers", Groubun will be smuggled into the hideout via the kitchen by Fordem.

- (Perception DC 17, DIS: Character is distracted by Whiskers or Hope) The character notices Fordem letting Groubun into the kitchen, with his satchel bag. Fordem then returns to the bar.

If a player was actively looking or watching Groubun from another location in the tavern:

- (Stealth DC 10, ADV: The tavern is busy, DIS: The character has directly interacted with Groubun or Fordem) Fordem seems to glance around the tavern, before indicating to Groubun to head into the kitchen.

Regardless if the party sees Groubun slip away, Fordem will claim he dropped off part of his tab he'd promised to repay, then headed off.
If the party stays at the tavern for another hour, they can repeat the perception check from before to notice Groubun slipping back out of the kitchen and the tavern.
He will be heading back to the Ordo to sleep if the party elects to follow him again.

After this, there is nothing story-wise to be gained at the tavern.
Resolve any gambling the players decide to do using the rules below.

### Adopting Whiskers

The antimagic collar and necklaces that Hope and Fordem have on indirectly prevent the party from "adopting" Whiskers, despite theirs (and his!) best efforts.
The necklaces can be stolen with suitably high DC sleight of hand checks, but obviously failure will be punished severely.
The collar itself also prevents Whiskers from leaving the tavern _of his own accord_ - the party can carry him out of the tavern for example, if they are suitably good at cat-smuggling.
If they cat-smuggle, they will have to get past the patrons, bouncer, and Fordem/Hope of course.

## Gambling

If one or more party members elect to join the table where patrons are playing dice, describe the game as follows.
Everyone puts in a starting bet - the patrons will match a bet of up to 1 GP to start with, the total pot should be ~5GP after all patrons and players have declared themselves in.
To avoid rolling so many dice, have all but one patron duck out after the "up the ante" stage.

### The Game

The player with the highest dice total will win the pot.
However, rolling the maximum number on a dice causes it to "explode" - a player will be allowed to roll an identical dice one additional time to increase their score if this happens, but only after the "up the ante" phase.

#### Initial Ante

Initial buy-in bets are placed.

#### Initial Roll

Each player rolls a d4, d6, d8, and d20, keeping the results hidden.
Once every player has rolled, each player _must_ reveal their D20 and one other dice.
Do not resolve explosions yet, but take note that any dice that are revealed at the maximum value _will_ explode.

#### Up the Ante

In poker-style, starting from the player with the highest revealed total, each player checks/matches the ante, raises the ante, or folds.
In the event of a tied total, the player who revealed the dice with the greatest number of sides goes first (excluding the d20).
If this is still a tie, both players roll a d4 and the player with the highest roll goes first (continuing to roll until a winner emerges).

Folding looses all money placed into the pot.
Once all players have either folded or matched the highest bet on the table, proceed to the next phase.

#### Reveal and Explode

All remaining players reveal their hidden dice.
Starting with the player who last upped the ante, resolve dice explosions to determine their total.
The player with the highest total, _after_ resolving explosions, wins the entire pot.
In the event of a tie, the pot is split between winners.

NOTE: Dice can explode multiple times. If a player rolls a 4 on their d4 for example, then rolls another d4 for the explosion and _also_ gets a 4, then they take _another_ d4 and roll again. Each dice adds to their total as did the previous.

#### Example

3 players enter the initial buy-in phase, and roll their dice.
Scores in **bold** are the ones that the players choose to reveal.

```bash
A : d4 - 2, **d6 - 5**, d8 - 2, **d20 - 19**
B : **d4 - 4**, d6 - 3, d8 - 7, **d20 - 20**
C : **d4 - 3**, d6 - 6, d8 - 8, **d20 - 13**
```

The player with the highest revealed total is tied between player A & B, however player A has revealed their d6 value compared to B's d4, so they go first.
Player A checks - seeing B's d20 and d4 that are going to explode.
B then plays and opts to up the ante by 1 GP.
C elects to match B's bet, hoping that their hidden d6 and d8s that are exploding will tip the balance.
A then folds, and since we are back to B's turn, the up the ante phase is over.
The pot is how 5 GP (3 from buy-in, 2 from up the ante).

B then reveals his remaining dice.
His total is 4 + 3 + 7 + 20 = 34, and then his d4 and d20 explode.
He rolls again, getting a 2 on the d20 and a 3 on the d4.
Thus, his grand total is 4 + 3 + 7 + 20 + 3 + 2 = 39.

C then reveals their dice; with a score of 3 + 6 + 8 + 13 = 30.
They reroll the d6 and d8, getting another 6 on the d6 and a 3 on the d8.
Their second d6 _also_ explodes, so they roll another one and get a 4.
This gives a total of 3 + 6 + 8 + 13 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 43.

Player C wins and takes the entire pot of 5GP, and the game ends.
