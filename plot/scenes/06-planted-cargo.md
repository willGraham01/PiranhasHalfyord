# The Planted Cargo

## Before the Night is Out

The party might have unfinished business before they head back to Shufharz;

- They might want to investigate Groubun's quarters in the Ordo if they tracked him to the Day's Rest. They will likely have to sneak into the building as everyone will be asleep for the night, but the information on the upper floors and in the lab will still be available.
- They may choose to visit the temple to try and corroborate Groubun's story, which the on-duty priests will quickly rebuff. The priests will tell the party that they aren't expecting any deliveries from the Ordo due to the current supply crisis.
- Some final scouting of the Day's Rest tavern will reveal the "backdoor" sewer entrance through a manhole in the back alley behind the tavern.

## Going over the Plan

Once the party returns to the barracks, go over the key aspects of their plan.
Make sure you know everyone's initial positions for the reverse heist the following day.
Shufharz will be present to show the party to their temporary quarters and answer and questions they might have.
Recall and remind the players that the objective for tomorrow is:

- To successfully fool the gang members into springing their attack on the cargo,
- To track any captured loot back to the gang's hideout,
- To capitalise on the discovery of the hideout, if possible.

Once the players are ready, allow them to take a long rest and move to the next day, at the docks.

## The Day of the Heist

The following day will see the docks in it's usual busy state.
There will be many dock workers present and going about their business, along with the harbourmaster (unless a player is masquerading as them).
Shufharz and a retinue of guards will be further along the docks, pretending to be on patrol so as not to arouse suspicion.

When the ship arrives, important groups of people and their locations - assuming a party member has not taken their role - are:

- The harbourmaster will be at the top of the stairs to the mooring station, likely conversing with the ship captain.
- 3 genuine dock workers on the mooring station and loading area.
- A guard in plain clothes disguised as a merchant loading his cart, from the loading area.
- 2 dock workers operating the crane.
- A group of 3 dock workers in the area between the mooring station and the bridge - either smoking, on a break, or supervising, etc.

The number of gang members sent to the docks will depend on the number of players, and whether or not Groubun was alerted the night before and tipped the gang off.
See the "gang presence" section below for information on how to balance the number of gang members and the number of animated constructs that spring up.
However, gang members will be present in the following locations when the ship pulls in:

- Near the billboard next to the docking crane. This will be the contingent that has the heist leader present, and they will be in dockworkers clothes (unless these were removed from the secret alcove).
- In the bridge underpass, wearing the traveller's attire (if it was left in the alcove).
- One gang member will be present in the loading area, acting as a dockworker (if the clothes were available) or otherwise hiding in the warehouse (taking clothes off the dock worker they've knocked out). He will have an invisibility potion on him, unless these were also lifted from the alcove.

### Pre-Heist

Before the ship pulls into port and starts unloading, the party can act on any hunches from the night before or inspect the area as usual.
Depending on what role they are playing (guards, dockworkers, the harbourmaster), the other characters in the area will treat them differently and the access they have might be limited.

Do not forget that the party should all have their earrings of message, so they can immediately relay information to one another.

#### Missing Dock Worker

Allow the party to overhear dock workers conversations prior to the ship arriving.

- (Perception, DC 12 PASSIVE) one group of dock workers will idly complain that they sent one of their comrades into the warehouse for tools and they're dawdling.
- (Perception, DC 15. AUTO if one of the party members is acting as a dock working in the loading station) The harbourmaster is one worker short after doing his role call and outlining the plans for the day.
- (Investigation, DC 10) All workers have signed in on the docking crane billboard, however one name has been crossed out and replaced by another.

If a character decides to investigate the warehouse, they will have to unlock the door (DC 15) or use the harbourmaster's key.
Depending on the role they are acting, they might be able to gain access another way (EG a guard can ask the harbourmaster for access).
Once inside the warehouse, the gang member will have knocked the dock worker unconscious already and hidden the sleeping working behind some crates and under a tarpaulin.
The character will enter and encounter the (disguised) gang member leaving - they may notice:

- (Perception/ Investigation, DC 17) The clothes do not quite fit the gang member (if the dockworkers clothes were removed from the stash last night).
- The gang member does not know that the dock worker was coming in to fetch tools, so will give themselves away if the player character questions them on what they're doing. Other red flags include the fact that the door was locked, and the gang member will not go back to the group of dock workers who mentioned their friend was missing.
- (Investigation, DC 20) The unconscious dock worker will be discovered.
- (Arcana/ Nature/ Alchemist kit, DC 15) He has been hit with a sleeping draught so won't be waking up for a while, but otherwise is unharmed.

#### Travellers Under the Bridge

The group of gang members under the bridge can be seen from the mooring station.

- (Perception, DC 15 ADV: the players found the cache last night) The illusionary brazier is lit and one of the gang members is partly hidden in the alcove.
- (Perception, DC 20 +10: the above check was passed) They are distributing the potions in the alcove (if they are there already) or look confused (since there are not supplies).

If approached, the gang members will not want to pick a fight since they are in view of the ferry stations on the other side of the bridge.

- A character acting as a guard can get the group to "move on", and potentially question them of their motives. The gang will claim to be tourists and they've just got lost / are getting their bearings. If convinced to move on, they will relocate to the top of the bridge when the heist triggers.
- A character acting as a dockworker or the harbourmaster can also interact with the group. In this case, they will claim they are investors who want to monitor the security of the docks in light of news of the recent attacks. They will not move on without more persuading.

#### Not Helping with the Crane

The gang member in charge of the heist will be at the docking crane, but will be looking out and waiting to give the signal rather than actually helping the real dock workers operate the crane.

A character playing a role with suitable authority can convince this gang member to start pitching in, which will reduce the coordination of the gang's attack (the group under the bridge will be considered surprised for the first round of action when things start to heat up).

#### Other Misc Setup Options

- The party is free to position the docking crane however they see fit before the ship arrives. They're also free to use it as they see fit before the gang turns up.
- The party can attempt to repair the damaged sewer cover, which will prevent the animated loot from escaping so quickly and give more time for trackers to be placed.

## Springing to Action

The ship will arrive shortly after the party has finished up any prep work or investigations they have been conducting.
When it turns up the captain will disembark to talk to the harbourmaster, and the dock workers will join the crew in unloading the crates on board the ship (and potentially loading this into the merchant's cart).
The gang will be waiting for confirmation that the shipment is valuable, which can come in a couple of ways:

- A character imitating the harbourmaster and/or captain may deliberately raise their voice when discussing the ship manifest. The merchant might also do this.
- Any characters disguised as dock workers can sow rumours to the gang members in plain clothes to entice them into acting early.
- Crane operators and other dock workers can pretend there is more weight in the crates than expected.
- The merchant can be engaged in conversation by a guard character to "spill the beans" on what's in the shipment.

Once the gang is confident that the shipment contains valuables, they will move in as part of their plan.

### The Gang's Plan

If uninterrupted, the Piranhas gang have the plan below.
Skill checks indicate ways in which the players might spot these actions prior to things kicking off.
Also indicate to the players that they can act to interrupt this plan at any time.

- The leader (disguised at the crane) will give the signal to the member who was hiding the warehouse. (Perception DC 15, ADV: the gang member was previously made to get to work helping with the crane).
- This gang member will join the dock workers doing the unloading. (Perception DC 20, ADV/AUTO: The warehouse was investigated).
- The group of investors will walk through the archway and head towards the merchant cart. (Perception DC 10) If they are on the bridge due to being moved on, they will arrive along the road instead, in clearer view (AUTO).
- On the leader's signal:
  - The "investors" will target the goods in the cart, morphing the crates and their contents. They will then attempt to use the invisibility potions to escape.
  - The "dock worker" will target the loading area, and also attempt to go invisible and flee.
  - The gang leader will animate some of the barrels on the loading bay, and again attempt to flee.

The gang members intend to retreat to the hideout as fast as possible.
The animated barrels are intended as a delaying action and to add chaos to the scene, preventing pursuit.
The animated cargo will attempt to head to the hideout via the sewer grate - if it realises that it is inaccessible, they will swim across the river and make their way to the hideout by the roads and streets.

### Combat Encounter

The number of enemies at the docks should vary based on the number of players present.
But there will always be:

- The gang members; at the crane, at the loading station, and the plain clothed members (3)
- If Groubun was alerted the night before, have 3 more gang members be present on the bridge with crossbows, to cover the retreat (3). This may tip the encounter from easy to medium difficulty.
- The barrels animated by the leader use the animated barrels stat block (player-number dependant).
- The animated cargo, which uses the loot wolf stat block (player-number dependent).

Keep in mind that the gang members want to get out alive, and the animated cargo does too.
The barrels will attempt to block escape and disrupt the dock workers, and party.

### Initiative

Go into initiative order when the action demands it due to the gang springing their attack, or a player reacting or pre-empting this.
The character with the Ring of Seeking should be allowed an opportunity to target either an invisible gang member (to track them back to the hideout) or one of the animated loot objects, so there is contingency if combat goes poorly.
As a final bout of contingency, have Shufharz and a guard retinue arrive from the market square and delay and gang members escaping by the road - if a gang member is captured, they can be interrogated to gain the same information as tracking would.
Shufharz' retinue can also be used to speed up the fight against the animated barrels if the danger has largely passed, or the party is split between staying on the docks to help and chasing the fleeing gang.

## Tracking

Once the dust settles, Shufharz will briefly rendezvous with the party having arrived from the market if the situation calls for it.
Otherwise, the party should take the lead in following either the gang members or the animated cargo (using the Ring if necessary).
Shufharz will not accompany the party for this due to the chaos on the docks.

If using the Ring of Seeking, the party can follow the trail back to the hideout underneath the Day's Rest.
If pursuing gang members, stealth checks contested by the gang member's passive perception will be needed.
The cargo (if above ground) can be followed without worry of alerting it - in fact, members of the public will gladly point the way / be in shock if the cargo travels by land.
Hope in the next scene will also be able to share more information if the cargo comes in the front door.

If the cargo went via the sewers, then have the trail lead to the manhole round the back of the Day's Rest tavern.
The blue line afforded by the Ring of Seeking (if active) will then direct the party into the hideout via the cellar entrance (since it highlights the shortest path to the target!).
If the Ring of Seeking isn't available, the party will need to put the clues they have available together.
If the party is truly stuck, have sounds start to be heard from the pipes underneath the manhole, and allow a perception check to deduce the direction they are going in.
