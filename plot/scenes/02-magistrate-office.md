# The Magistrate's Office

## Setting

The (potentially newly formed) party is lead from the market to the magistrates office at the end of the "main street", the market square is visible when they get to the exterior of the building.
Shufharz will lead them inside to Kamonas' office.
On the way the party might overhear representatives discussing the recent attack, demanding a briefing, and other things - there is a general sense of unrest.
Once they reach Kamonas' office, they will receive a briefing from the two officials and (hopefully) have some work to do.

## The Briefing

After introductions, Shufharz and Kamonas will ask for the party's help.
Shufharz can recommend them due to their actions (if sufficient) in the market, or failing that Kamonas can play the "we need people who won't have been gotten to" card.
Should the party hear the two out, they will brief the party on the situation as described in the background.
The party might also have questions, which the officials will be happy to answer during or after the briefing - they will even provide answers before the briefing if the party asks first.
The key details to provide (and which of the two officials will provide them if one is particularly more suited than the other) are listed below:

- The immediate problem (Kamonas)
  - Magic-induced raids
  - The missing Ordinator
  - Context clues (Shufharz)
- A brief history on the Piranhas gang (Shufharz);
  - The recent decline
  - The recent magical attacks
  - The recovered necklace from the treasury heist
  - Their leader and command structure
  - Their unknown hideout
  - Their criminal activities
- The Ordo Magicae
  - The outpost's role
  - Outpost staff numbers and important people; Faire, his apprentice, Jenessa the shop-face
  - Assistance in the investigation
    - Groubun is now very busy but his information has been helpful
    - Jenessa has more time and has been actively trying to help at each turn
- The stakes
  - The town is restless and it's governor and law enforcement are taking flack
  - The trade that keeps the town afloat is beginning to suffer

Once the party has enough information, Shufharz will let them in on the plan involving the docks tomorrow, and set them on an errand to fetch an item from the Ordo.
She will also explain that - keeping up the guise that an important shipment is coming tomorrow - they will be doing some reconossence on the docking area shortly.
The party will be invited to either:

- Pick up the item from Jenessa at the Ordo, then meet Shufharz at the docks, or
- Head to the docks with Shufharz, then onto the Ordo for closing time.

Shufharz will prefer the former, since Jenessa's item may be of use, and it mitigates the amount of time the party is seen actively working with the garrison.
Before sending them to the Ordo, Shufharz will provide a small stamp or mark that the party can show to Jenessa to confirm they are working with the garrison.

## Next Scenes

The party should either head to:

- 03 - the Ordo Magicae if they choose to meet Jenessa there first, or
- 04 - the docks at night if they choose to go with Shufharz.
