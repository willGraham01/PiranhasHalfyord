# Sample Player Characters

The Piranhas of Halyford is intended to be an introductory adventure, and to help new players avoid the complexities of character creation we provide a couple of sample player characters that are designed to fit into the adventure.
They each come with a short backstory that can be expanded on by creative players, and their appearance (beyond race restrictions) is to be determined by the player.
The DM is also free to help make small edits to the races and backstories - none of the character's races are particularly integral parts of their kit.

Disclaimer: these characters were created using the 2014 version of the rules, and have not been updated to the 2024 version.
The Rogue in particular uses the Inquisitive subclass, which came with Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and is yet to be re-released with 2024 rules.
DMs running games in which other characters are using the 2024 character creation method may want to re-work these sample characters to make them more on-par with the newer characters that come out of character creation.

By providing these sample characters, it is hoped that new players can familiarise themselves with the rules of _playing_ Dnd without getting stuck in character creation (and potentially making bad choices unknowingly whilst they do so).
We give a short summary of how each character is "intended to play" (in a mechanical sense) and their original backstory that can help new players decide on which one they want to play.
Note that we won't be explaining any of the rules here - we will be leaving that up to you to do.
The summary text is written to make sense without any understanding of the rules, however the text outlining strengths and weaknesses will need a person to have had the fundamental concepts of the game explained to them.

## The Rogue

The sample rogue is designed to be an investigator; their sample backstory is that they've been hired by the Ordo Magicae to investigate the disappearance of one of their members in Halfyord.
Their skills are also tailored to reflect a private-detective character - they have high-quality investigation skills, can read people easily, and have the means to access areas they are unauthorised to go if they need to.
They are fairly young for a (wood) elf, and it is usually quite odd to see such an elf away from a forest community.

Their skills primarily revolve around uncovering hidden information, either through subterfuge or by reading people.
They are particularly good at:

- Using _thieves' tools_ to pick locks, and gaining access to areas they might not have access to undetected (_stealth_).
- (_Investigating_) an area for clues or hidden details.
- Reading people's body language to see if they're lying (_Insight_, _Ear for Deceit_ ability).
- Being aware of your surroundings and picking out details (_Perception_).
- You are also quite knowledgeable of current and historical events (_History_).

Most of their other abilities try to complement these strengths.

### Rogue In Combat

The rogue isn't the toughest fighter, and typically wants to be attacking from range with their shortbow - though they do have a rapier (sword) if they need to get up close and personal.
How they fight should revolve around their _cunning action_ and _sneak attack_ abilities - on most turns you want to try and make an attack against an enemy who will be affected by _sneak attack_.
Long story short, they want to stay out of range and just out of sight of behind some kind of cover, and target the enemies that their friends are already distracting.

Sneak attack deals extra damage when to enemies that are distracted or unaware of the rogue's position.
The character sheet describes to trigger this extra damage:
\begin{itemize}
    - Target enemies who are already fighting your friends in melee.
    - If you are hidden (after taking the _Hide_ action), you will get advantage when you attack someone, which also triggers your sneak attack.
    - They also have the_Insightful Fighting_ ability if there is no other way to apply sneak attack.
\end{itemize}

Due to their _cunning action_ ability, there's a lot of things you can do with their bonus action.
For example, they can disengage using a _bonus action_ if an enemy gets too close - and then use their _action_ to attack them with the shortbow after moving away.
The primary interplay between _cunning action_ and _sneak attack_ is that can also _hide_ as a bonus action (via _cunning action_) - so there is always the combination of hiding from an enemy with their bonus action, and then on the same turn attacking that enemy after hiding to get _sneak attack_!
Alternatively, _hiding_ after attacking someone so that they don't try and take revenge on their turn isn't a bad idea!

## The Sorcerer

The sample sorcerer provides some insight into the magical aspects of the world, and is something of a "glass cannon" in a fight - capable of devastating magical attacks but very vulnerable to melee attacks.
Their sample backstory is that they were educated by the Ordo Magicae after their latent magical abilities began to emerge, and have since found gainful employment working with the guild.
They are in Halfyord on an errand to check in with the status of the guild's outpost there.

Possessing dragon ancestry makes them quite _intimidating_ to most people - but they might want to be careful about who they try and scare.
Their natural magical abilities give good insights into the nature of magic (_Arcana_) and the divine forces (_Religion_).

They also know a few spells that might be useful outside of combat.
_Light_ is always useful to illuminate dark areas, and _Minor Illusion_ can be good for creating distractions - both are cantrips so can be cast as many times as wanted.
_Charm Person_ is a useful fall-back option if they need to sweet talk someone, and _Detect Magic_ can be used to check for magical traps or gain insight into something known to be magical.

### Sorcerer In Combat

Whilst they have a decent amount of HP, they're very easy to hit, so will want to try and stay away from enemies.
Instead, focus on using spells to do damage or impede the enemies - the _Metamagic_ ability goes a long way to making their spells more powerful.

On most of their turns, casting a spell is usually how their action will be spend - it is generally not worth using their melee weapons unless there's really no other option!
_Firebolt_ deals damage at range, whilst _Shocking Grasp_ lets hits enemies that get too close.
Both are cantrips, so they don't cost anything to cast.

If looking for area-of-effect damage, _Shatter_ should be the go-to option.
_Web_ is a great spell for slowing enemies down - preventing them from reaching the party to attack, or to help the party run away!
Being a Dragonborn, they also have a _Breath Weapon_ for some rather nice damage, but it can't be used many times before it needs to recharge.

_Metamagic_ can be used to turn a spell:into a _bonus action_.
This means they can do something else with their action, such as hide, disengage if the enemies are too close - or even just cast another spell using their action as well!
_Metamagic_ can also be used to increase the range of spells, if they find themselves too far away from the action.
Keep in mind _Metamagic_ uses up _Scorcery points_ though - they only come back after a rest.
