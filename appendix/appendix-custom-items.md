## Ring of Seeking

Uncommon magic item.

A small ring formed of interlaced copper bands, with a small opal inset.
The opal can be rotated in it's socket to activate or deactivate the ring's magical effects.

The ring has a charge that lasts for 1 hour.
This timer is paused when the ring is deactivated.
The timer can only be reset by recharging the ring by spending 10 minutes channelling magic into the ring, expending spell slots whose level sums to at least 3.
For example, one 3rd-level spell slot, or one 2nd-level and one 1st-level spell slot, can be used to recharge the ring.
The ring cannot be partially recharged by expending fewer spell slots.
The spell slots to be used in the recharging are not expended if the recharging process is interrupted in some way.

As a bonus action, a character can twist the opal into either the activated or deactivated position.

When activated, the wearer of the ring gains the following abilities:

### Highlight Invisibility

Invisible creatures within 45 feet of the wearer are outlined in a red shimmer.

### End Invisibility

As an action, the wearer can point at such an invisible creature within 45 feet using the hand wearing the ring, and the effect(s) causing the creature's invisibility ends.

If the source of the creature's invisibility is a spell of 3rd level or greater, the target can make a DC 13 constitution saving throw to resist this effect.
Succeeding on this save does not grant immunity to the effects of this action, should the ring's wearer try again.

### Clairvoyance

As an action, the wearer can point at one celestial, construct, fey, fiend, undead, or magic item within 45 feet.
For the duration of the charge, a blue line appears on the ground that follows the shortest path between the wearer and the target.

Pointing at a new creature in this way removes the blue line from the previous one.
If the charge runs out, this line disappears and must be re-applied by pointing at the target again, after recharging the ring.

The path deems physical gaps that the wearer cannot pass through impassible; and seeks another route should something happen to block the path in this way (EG a cavern collapse).
The path is not blocked by doors, grates, trapdoors, or similar obstacles that can be opened in some way.

## Networked Earrings of Message

Uncommon magic item(s).

Small earrings that can be either clipped onto, or placed through an existing piercing in, a character's ear.
Each earring is a small blue crystal laced in silver, and the set consists of between 2 and 10 earrings.

As an action, the wearer of one of these earrings can cast the *message* cantrip, using only verbal components.
This casting targets all other characters who are wearing the other earrings in the set, and ignores the requirement to point in the direction of the creature.
Other restrictions to the spell apply as usual.

All characters wearing the other earrings in the set, and whom the message can reach, hear the telepathic message when it is sent.
