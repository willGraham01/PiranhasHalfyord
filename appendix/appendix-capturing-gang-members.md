# Appendix: Captured Gang Members

Over the course of the adventure is it very possible that the party will be able to take a Piranhas' gang member alive; specifically they will have opportunities to do this during:

- [The attack on the market](../scenes/01-the-market-attack.md), if they are quick enough to act.
- Their return from the Day's Rest at night, if they [trigger the optional encounter](../scenes/05-the-days-rest-tavern.md#dont-tread-on-the-fish).
- During the [events at the docks](../scenes/06-planted-cargo.md), during the day.

The information that captured gang members could give up should be carefully managed so that the plot is not derailed.
Of course, this is not necessary if you are OK with diverging from the expected storyline and improvising.
However if a gang member were to be captured in the first scene, the party may try and obtain the location of the hideout from them, straight away, for example.
As such, we outline the recommended information that captured gang members should be able to give up, at various stages of the adventure.
Of course, captured gang members are under no obligation to be cooperative either - coercion or charm might be necessary to get any information at all.

## After the Market Attack

Gang members captured during the market attack will have minimal information to offer about the gang's logistics, but can at least impart basic information:

- They will have received their assignment via gang communications - dead drops (which is also where they got the potions from), covert meetings, and similar.
  - They will not mention the gang symbols unless they are directly confronted by a character with knowledge of them. They may have to be persuaded to translate them - being offered a commuted sentence or the like in exchange for co-operation.
- They have not actually set foot in the hideout, nor are aware of where it even is (or if it is still operational). They can offer up the information that none of the lower-ranked gang members have seen Carlton for ages.
- If asked where they live or are staying (and )

If asked about what they instructed the animated loot to do, or how the potions work:

- Gang members have no innate magical skills. They follow the instructions left with the bottles when they pick them up.
- These instructions mention that, once animated, gang members should mentally instruct the loot to "move to the gang vault". Even though the gang members do not know where this is, it seems to work.
- They do not know where the potions come from, though they will note that they have been a staple of the gang's operations for a few weeks now.

Gang members captured at this point are also not affiliated with the Day's Rest.

- If asked where they are staying / living, they will direct the party to one of the poorer, shadier areas of town.

## After Leaving the Day's Rest

Once the party leaves the Day's Rest after their visit at night, any gang members they capture can offer up slightly more information.
Those that attempt an ambush of the party will have spent the evening in the Day's Rest.

- These gang members will mention that the Day's Rest is frequented by gang members, and is often used as a meeting point that can be covered up as a social gathering of friends.
  - Captured gang members will not know who Fordem is, but they do know that the book-keeper overseeing the fighting ring in the tavern is a a more senior gang member.
  - Note that once the party leaves the tavern, the book-keeper will spend the evening in the hideout itself. If the party returns the same evening with the intent to arrest, have Fordem lie and claim that the book-keeper left for the evening a short while ago. Fordem will deny knowing where the book-keeper's home is (since in reality, he doesn't have one and is in the hideout!).
  - They will mention that their accommodation had been arranged in the tavern's rooms beforehand, and in the morning they would receive their instructions for the day ahead.
    - Unbeknownst to these gang members, Fordem would have briefed them in the morning - but obviously he will not doing so now! If the party does turn up to the Day's Rest in the early hours of the morning, they might be able to catch some of the remaining gang members at breakfast, but they will all be plain-clothed and mixed in with genuine civilian patrons having their breakfast.
- The gang members do not know what their assignment was going to be, though they will have heard about the "big shipment" coming in tomorrow morning.

## After the Events at the Docks During the Day

Any gang members captured at this point will be slightly more senior.
They can give out a bit more information, but will be harder to convince to give up said information willingly.

- They know about the hideout under the Day's Rest, and know Fordem is a senior gang member from the "good old days".
  - They know that Hope is not affiliated with the gang, and is ignorant of the gang's activities in the tavern.
  - They know that the vault is inside the hideout, and is accessible (for the animated loot, at least) via the sewers. A one-way trapdoor - too small for a human or similar creature - allows animated loot to drop into the vault from the ceiling.
  - They know that access to the hideout is gained via the cellar. They also know how to get in, by pressing a gang necklace to the hidden gang mark in one of the walls.
- They know that Carlton is holding out in the hideout, as he has been doing for a long while now.
  - They can discuss Carlton's situation; he wants to re-establish the gang elsewhere, but lacks the funds to do so.
  - If asked why Carlton doesn't just leave, these gang members will reveal that they would sell Carlton out if they caught the whiff of such an idea. They'll also reveal that they know that Carlton must know this, hence the plan to try and re-establish the gang elsewhere, with enough funds to keep everyone's faith in Carlton's leadership alive.
