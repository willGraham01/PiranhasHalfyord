title: Networked Earrings of Message
---

Uncommon magic item(s).

Small earrings that can be either clipped onto, or placed through an existing piercing in, a character's ear.
Each earring is a small blue crystal laced in silver, and the set consists of between 2 and 10 earrings.

As an action, the wearer of one of these earrings can cast the *message* cantrip at a range of 120ft., without components.
This casting targets all other characters who are wearing the other earrings in the set, and ignores the requirement to point in the direction of the creature.
Other restrictions to the spell apply as usual.

All characters wearing the other earrings in the set, and whom the message can reach, hear the telepathic message when it is sent.
Characters who cannot receive the message due to obstructions hear static feedback in their ears, but are aware someone has attempted to send a message.
Characters out of range do not hear anything, nor are they aware a message was sent.

## In the Adventure

Shufharz will give the party a set of these earrings when they meet her at the [docks at night](../scenes/04-scouting-the-docks.md), to conduct reconnaissance.
She will take them back at the conclusion of the adventure.
