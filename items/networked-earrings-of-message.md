# Networked Earrings of Message

Uncommon magic item(s).

Small earrings that can be either clipped onto, or placed through an existing piercing in, a character's ear.
Each earring is a small blue crystal laced in silver, and the set consists of between 2 and 10 earrings.

As a free action, the wearer of one of these earrings can cast the *message* cantrip, at a range of 60ft.
This casting targets all other characters who are wearing the other earrings in the set, and does not require line of sight - though thick stone, metal, or other materials may block the message reaching certain targets.
All characters wearing the other earrings in the set hear the telepathic message when it is sent.
