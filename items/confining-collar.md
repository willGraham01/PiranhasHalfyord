# Confining Collar

Very rare magic item.

A collar made of some dull metal alloy, engraved with subtle magical runes that extend all around the band.
It comes with a small key that looks more like a token than a tradition key with a handle and teeth.

The collar can be placed around the neck of a willing creature, or attempted to be forced onto an unwilling creature with a contested check at the DM's discretion.
The collar will expand to fit tightly around the wearer's neck if it is too small or large to fit normally.

## Donning the Collar

When the collar is placed onto a creature, it becomes bound to the building it is currently standing in and cannot willingly leave.
If donned in an open area such as a street or field, the creature is bound either by the nearest confining landmarks (the fences of a field, walls of a city, for example) or a 60 foot square area whose centre is the point it donned the collar.
The DM should use their discretion to rule what the confinement area is in this case.

Existing magical effects on the creature, that are not permanent (such as True Polymorph), immediately end when the collar is donned.

Once donned, the collar locks into position and can only be unlocked using the key that it is paired to.

## Wearing the Collar

Whilst wearing the collar, the creature is immune to all magical effects (short of a Wish spell) that do not originate from itself or its equipment, all magical damage or damage from magical sources, and cannot take the Magic action.
When the collar would block or nullify magical effects in this way, the runes on the collar light up with an intensity that varies with the power of the effect that was dispelled.
Greater and more powerful effects (EG higher level spells and abilities) cause the runes to glow with higher intensities than lower level spells or cantrips.

It is also bound to the area it donned the collar in (see [donning the collar](#donning-the-collar), above) and cannot willingly leave this area.
If it is forcibly removed from this area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw every hour it is away from the location, otherwise it involuntarily begins to return to the location in the most sensible way possible.

## Removing the Collar

Holding the paired key next to the collar causes a small humming sound to be emitted for 30 seconds, after which point the collar unlocks and falls from the neck of the wearer.

If the key is ever destroyed, the collar immediately unlocks and cannot be locked again, until paired with a new key.

## In the Adventure

Groubun has manufactured the collar as an offshoot from his latest research project, and uses it to keep Faire trapped as a cat at the Day's Rest Tavern.
The party can find clues to the collar's design in Groubun's lab notes, and the key to the collar in Groubun's room at the Ordo.
