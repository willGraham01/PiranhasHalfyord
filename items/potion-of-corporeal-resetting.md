# Potion of Corporeal Resetting

Rare magic item (potion).

The surface of the liquid in this potion always remains perpendicular to the bottle it is contained in, no matter what orientation the bottle is rotated to.

## Ingesting the Potion

A creature that ingests or is administered the entirety of the potion, and is not in its intrinsic form due to either shapeshifting or being under the affects of a polymorph spell, reverts to its intrinsic form over the course of one minute.
The change reverts any effects such as items being worn being absorbed into the creatures form, or temporary hit points gained from its previous form.

Once the creature's form reverts, it forgets everything it experienced and learnt between the present moment (including being administered the potion itself) and the last time it was in its intrinsic form.
This will typically cause most creatures to become disorientated and confused by their surroundings, and by their saviours.

The potion has no effect on creatures that are currently in their intrinsic form.

## In the Adventure

This potion can be found in Groubun's room in the Ordo Magicae.
Groubun and Carlton plan to administer this potion to Faire as part of the plan to frame him, once the Piranhas are in a position to escape Halfyord.
