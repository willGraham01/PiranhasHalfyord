# Potion of Animating

Rare magic item (potion).

A bottled liquid that seems to possess small [Eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics)) even when the bottle is resting on a shelf.
The liquid cannot be separated into two pools when poured from one container into another, acting like a highly viscous fluid and wrapping itself around any barrier that is inserted between the two containers.
Physically blocking part of the liquid in this way (EG by replacing the top of a bottle cap) causes the liquid to loose its potency and magical effects.
Combining the liquid from two potions of animating causes the two liquids to meld into a single fluid that occupies the same space as the larger of the two individual liquids, and bestows no additional potency.

## Animate Objects

If the bottle is thrown with force and shatters, the liquid splashes out over a 5 foot radius area, applying its effect to all non-worn, non-carried, non-magical small or smaller items within the radius.
The affected items begin to morph and pull themselves together, forming into 1d4 [animated loot](../monsters/animated-loot.md) monsters under the control of the creature that threw the bottle, or otherwise caused it to shatter.
The DM may rule that fewer or greater creatures are created in this way, if the affected area is particularly sparse or dense with suitable target objects.

Any liquid on the constituent items forms a cohesive glue that appears to bind the animated loot's new form together, which disappears after the animated loot dissipates.

Residue remains in the area after the liquid splashes, but looses its potency.
It can still be analysed by a character with suitable expertise, potentially identifying the potion or some of the ingredients.

## Ingesting the Potion

A creature that ingests a potion of animating must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 3d10 poison damage, taking half as much damage on a success.
This poison damage ignores any resistance or immunities the target may have.
The creature also receives the Poisoned condition (even if it is normally immune to it) for 1d4 hours.
