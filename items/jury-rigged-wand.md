title: Jury-Rigged Wand
---

Uncommon magic item.

A wand that consists of a silver, metallic rod with a leather strap fastened to one end, acting as a grip.
Small runes are carved in patterns up the exposed metal, however the rod does not end in a tip like most other wands would.

The wand is something that Groubun has crafted and given to the Piranhas' gang, using the materials that they provide him with from their raids.
It's erratic design is due to the fact that Groubun is making do with the random assortment of resources and materials the gang is providing him with - they have no idea what is useful with regards to creating magic items, so don't actively coordinate going after things that would be useful when combined.

The wand can cast a selection of spells before its instability gets the better of it, and it goes inert (in the best case scenario).
Even when using it, there is a chance that something goes wrong.

## Spellcasting

The jury rigged wand has five charges, which cannot be replenished.
A creature wielding the jury-rigged wand can cast the following spells from the wand;

- Counterspell,
- Hold Person (the casting creature must concentrate on this spell and remain in possession of the wand to maintain the effect of this spell),
- Dispel Magic

The spell save DC of the wand is 15, and it has no spell attack bonus (not that any spells that require this can be cast via the wand anyway).
A creature uses it's Intelligence score as the spellcasting ability if one of these spells requires it for any other reason.

The first casting of _each_ of the spells above costs 1 of the wand's charges.
Subsequent castings of a spell that has already been cast from the wand cost 1 of the wand's charges, but the caster must roll on the [wand's instabilities table](#instability) immediately after the effects of the cast spell are resolved.
Note that this roll will always cause the wand to loose an additional charge, and may take the "total" number of charges to a negative value.

For example; the following combinations of spells are all valid means of exhausting the wand's charges:

- Casting Counterspell (4 charges remain), then Dispel Magic (3 charges remain), then Counterspell again (2 charges after casting, then down to 1 charge after the effects of Counterspell are resolved), then Dispel Magic (0 charges remain, down to -1 after Dispel Magic's effects are resolved).
- Casting Counterspell (4 charges remain), then Hold Person (3 charges remain), then Dispel Magic (2 charges remain), then Counterspell again (1 charge remains, down to 0 after the effects of Counterspell are resolved).

## Instability

Groubun has pieced together this wand from spare materials the gang has bought him, that haven't gone into potions or his other research experiments.
This is reflected in how the wand behaves and appears; when casting from the wand, it vibrates erratically and small flashes of light (or varying colours) run along the rod and cause the runes to flare.
It cannot be recharged, and is not honed to a point like most wands are, but instead both ends are blunt circles.
The grip is little more than some leather that has been fasted to one end of the wand, and the runes that are scribed along the metal are imprecise enough to induce instabilities.

A creature may need to roll on the instabilities table after casting a spell using the wand.
In this case, the creature rolls a d4 and compares the result to the number of charges that the wand currently has:

- If the d4 roll is less than the number of remaining charges; the wand briefly vibrates in the caster's hand and the runes emit brief flashes of dim light, before settling back to its inert state. The ends of the leather grip unravel slightly, and the rod appears to warp and bend. Subsequent rolls of this type amplify these flavour effects, but have no gameplay implications.
- If the d4 roll is greater than the number of remaining charges, sparks seem to fly off the wand in multiple directions, and the runes emit flashes of bright light of multiple colours for a few seconds before calming. The leather grip loosens from the metal, and the ends of the strips that form the grip start to crisp and harden, as if being burnt. Any creature in contact with the wand takes 1d6 force damage.
- Regardless of the result of the d4, the wand then looses one additional charge.

## Inertia

Once the wand reaches 0 charges, it can no longer be used to cast spells, nor can it be recharged.
Provided it does not reach a negative amount of charges before an hour passes, the materials that make up the wand become inert and no longer hold any magical properties, or give off any magical auras if a Detect Magic or Identify spell is used in their vicinity.
At this point, the wand is considered destroyed, leaving only its mundane component pieces.

If the wand reaches a negative amount of charges, the frame and runes can no longer handle the stress of magical energy passing through the wand, and it emits a flash of bright light in a 5ft radius, and dim light out to a further 5 ft.
All creatures within 5ft of the wand when this happens take 1d6 - (the number of charges remaining in the wand) force damage.
Note that since the number of charges remaining in the wand in this scenario is negative, this will result in at least 1d6+1 force damage.
The wand itself shatters into its mundane components and looses all magical properties; the rod splits into two or more pieces depending on how warped it is, and the leather grip detaches from the rod and potentially burns or crumbles at the edges.

## In the Adventure

The wand is found inside Carlton's HQ, and Fordem will be within reach of it when the party enters the HQ for either parley or confrontation.

In practice, the wand is designed to mitigate combat-trivialising effects being applied to Shark Carlton.
Fordem will be in possession of the wand, and can use the wand to counter effects such as Paralysis or Stunned that get applied to Carlton via the use of spells.
It can also mitigate large AoE effects in the confined area that the HQ is.
