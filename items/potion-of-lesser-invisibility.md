title: Potion of Lesser Invisibility
---

Rare magic item (potion).

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid, and slooshing sounds can be heard inside the container if it is shaken.

## Ingesting the Potion

Ingesting the entirety of the potion causes a creature to become Invisible for up to 30 minutes, and requires the creature's concentration to maintain.
The effect ends early if the creature attacks or casts a spell.

## In the Adventure

Groubun is manufacturing these potions, along with [potions of animating](./potion-of-animating.md), and giving them to the Piranhas.
The party can recover some of these potions from [the hidden stash](../scenes/04-scouting-the-docks.md#investigations-the-bridge-underpass) at the docks.
