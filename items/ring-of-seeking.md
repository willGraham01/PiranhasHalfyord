# Ring of Seeking

Uncommon magic item.

A small ring formed of interlaced copper bands, with a small opal inset.
The opal can be rotated in it's socket to activate or deactivate the ring's magical effects.

As a bonus action, a character can twist the opal into either the activated or deactivated position.
The ring has a charge that lasts for 1 hour.
This timer is paused when the ring is deactivated, however does not reset without recharging the ring by expending a spell slots whose level sums to at least 3 (EG one 3rd-level spell slot, or one 2nd-level and one 1st-level spell slot, can be used to recharge the ring).

When activated, the wearer gains the following abilities:

- Invisible creatures within 45 feet of the wearer are outlined in a red shimmer.
- As an action, the wearer can point at such an invisible creature with the hand wearing the ring, and the creature's invisibility ends.
- As an action, the wearer can point at one magical creature, construct, or item within 45ft. For the duration of the charge, a blue line appears on the ground that follows the shortest path between the wearer and the target. Pointing at a new creature in this way removes the blue line from the previous one. If the charge runs out, this line disappears and must be re-applied by pointing at the target again, after recharging the ring.
